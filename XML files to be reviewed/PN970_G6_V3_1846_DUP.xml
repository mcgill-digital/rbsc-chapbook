            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">Pepin, King of France, had a sister,
                named<lb/>Bellisant, whose hand was demanded by several<lb/>kings and princes. Her
                choice fell on Alexander,<lb/>Emperor of Constantinople, who came to the<lb/>court
                of King Pepin to espouse her, and then es&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>cort her home in
                state as his bride.</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">Alexander's Prime minister, and favourite,
                was<lb/>a selfish and cruel arch&ndash;priest, who, fearing the<lb/>lovely empress
                would soon usurp his influence<lb/>over the emperor, resolved to effect her
                    destruc&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>tion.</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">The emperor, being of a suspicious
                disposition,<lb/>the arch&ndash;priest worked upon it for some time, at<lb/>first;
                and then one day, when the emperor was<lb/>alone, he entered his apartments, and
                said;&mdash;<lb/>&ldquo; Mighty king, may heaven guard your majesty<lb/>from the
                treacherous designs of your empress;<lb/>who, not content with faithlessness to your
                sacred<lb/>person, now seeks to destroy even your life,&rdquo;</p>

            <lb/>
            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">The emperor, implicitly believing the
                priest,<lb/>could not restrain his fury; but rushing into his<lb/>wife's apartment,
                he in a savage manner, dragged<lb/>her about by the hair, exclaiming, &ldquo;Base
                wretch !<lb/>I am but too well informed of your infamous pro&ndash;<lb type="inWord"
                />ceedings !&rdquo; Then dashing her on the ground, he<lb/>left her, desiring her to
                prepare herself for death.</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">The empress having by the help of her
                    atten&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>dants, somewhat recovered, sought the
                emperor,<lb/>and falling on her knees thus addressed him,&mdash;<lb/>&ldquo; Oh take
                pity on one who has ever faithfully<lb/>loved you ! I shall soon become a mother;
                and I<lb/>implore your compassion on behalf of my child !<lb/>let me be imprisoned
                until its birth ; and then, if<lb/>your anger be not appeased, do with me as
                you<lb/>please; but, oh! save my child! The emperor<lb/>replied, &ldquo; Perish,
                base woman, and the child of<lb/>your perfidy with you !&rdquo; when the courtiers,
                    see&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>ing any further appeal would but increase his
                rage<lb/>removed Bellisant from his presence.</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">Her faithful servant, Blandiman, now
                threw<lb/>himself at her feet, imploring her to leave her<lb/>barbarous husband, and
                suffer him to conduct her<lb/>to her brother's court, but she refused, as
                that<lb/>would imply a confession of guilt.</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">The emperor banished his queen, instead
                of<lb/>putting her to death, but forbade all persons, ex&ndash;<lb type="inWord"

                accompanied, she<lb/>soon reached the forest of Orleans, when overcome<lb/>with
                fatigue, she sank on a couch made up of<lb/>withered leaves and moss, prepared by

            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">It chanced that King Pepin was that day
                    hunt&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>ing in the forest, and passing near the spot
                where<lb/>the other infant laid, was surprised to see the lit&ndash;<lb
                    type="inWord"/>tle beauty, who held out his tiny arms, as if to ask<lb/>for
                protection. &ldquo;See, my lords,&rdquo; said King<lb/>Pepin, &ldquo;this lovely
                infant appears to solicit my<lb/>favour; I will adopt it as my own.&rdquo; He
                then<lb/>delivered the babe to one of the pages, who took<lb/>it to a nurse, and by
                the royal command, it re&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>ceived the name of Valentine.</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">Scarcely had the page galloped off when
                the<lb/>king met Blandiman, and demanded what news<lb/>from Constantinople, when
                hearing that the arch&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>priest had accused his royal sister
                of plotting the<lb/>emperor's death, he declared his belief in its<lb/>truth, and
                blamed the emperor for sparing her<lb/>life, adding, &ldquo;Let her beware how she
                comes into<lb/>my power.&rdquo;</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">Blandiman now sought his mistress, whom
                he<lb/>found half distracted with her accumulated mise&ndash;<lb type="inWord"
                />ries. She related to him the birth and dreadful<lb/>loss of her infant, and
                learning her brother's<lb/>unjust wrath against her, resolved to take shelter<lb/>in
                a monastery.</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">The bear that carried away the infant, took
                it<lb/>to her cave, and laid it before her young; the<lb/>cubs, however, instead of
                devouring it, fondled it<lb/>which the old one perceiving, gave it suck and<lb/>the
                child grew strong and hearty. As he in&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>creased in size and
                strength, he ranged the forest<lb/>attacking the wild beast with such fury, that
                they<lb/>dare not approach the cave in which he continued <pb n="9"/>

                till his eighteenth<lb/>year, when his strength was so amazing, and the<lb/>terror
                he caused in all the country round, so<lb/>great, that his renown spread all over
                France. He<lb/>was called Orson, from having been nurtured by<lb/>a bear.</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">Valentine, meanwhile, had been brought
                up<lb/>with the king's daughter, Eglantine, to whom<lb/>he was passionately

                the favours showered on him ex&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>citing the hatred of the
                king's sons, Henry and<lb/>Haufrey, they plotted to destroy him. A petition<lb/>from
                the peasants, praying protection against<lb/>Orson, being shortly after presented to
                the king,<lb/>he issued a proclamation in which he offered a<lb/>thousand marks of
                gold to whoever should bring<lb/>Orson, dead or alive, on which Henry told
                his<lb/>royal sire, that he thought no one so qualified to<lb/>undertake this
                hazardous enterprise as the found&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>ling Valentine, adding,
                &ldquo; and perhaps, if he<lb/>conquers the savage, you will reward him with<lb/>the
                hand of our sister, Eglantine.&rdquo; The king,<lb/>seeing their envy, frowned
                displeasure; but Va&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>lentine, hinting that the advice was
                given in the<lb/>hope of encompassing his death, declared that it<lb/>concerned his
                honor, and he would brave the<lb/>danger willingly, to preserve it unsullied.</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">At the first dawn of morning, Valentine
                arose<lb/>and putting on his armour, took a shield, po&ndash;<lb type="inWord"

                Presently he heard Orson, who<lb/>had a buck with him which he had just
                killed<lb/>come roaring by ; and he could not help ad&ndash;<lb type="inWord"
                />miring the beauty of his make, and his agility,<lb/>wishing it were possible to
                tame him. He then<lb/>tore off the branch of a tree, and threw it at<lb/>Orson, who,
                looking up, uttered a furious howl<lb/>and darted up the tree like lightning.
                    Valen&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>tine descended, and Orson, seeing him on
                the<lb/>ground, rushed down, when Valentine, holding<lb/>up his shield, Orson,
                evidently surprised and de&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>lighted, beheld his own image.
                Valentine then<lb/>lowered the shield, when Orson, tearing up a<lb/>huge tree by the
                roots, attacked him, and a<lb/>dreadful fight ensued, Orson receiving
                many<lb/>wounds. The bear, hearing Orson's cries, now<lb/>rushed forth, when
                Valentine aimed a blow,<lb/>which would have killed her, had not Orson<lb/>rushed
                forward and throwing one arm round its<lb/>neck, with supplicating gestures seemed
                to beg<lb/>that he would not hurt her. Valentine, in token<lb/>of kindness, then
                offered Orson some grapes, and<lb/>a bottle of strong liquor, which he no
                sooner<lb/>tasted, then he gave them to the bear, throwing<lb/>his arms round her
                whilst she devoured them,<lb/>and she uttering a gentle growl, to express
                her<lb/>satisfaction. The strong liquor, however, soon<lb/>caused her death; on
                which Orson stood for a few<lb/>moments motionless, supposing her to be
                only<lb/>asleep; he then endeavoured to rouse her, but<lb/>finding all his efforts
                ineffectual, his grief was<lb/>scarcely to be described, uttering the
                most<lb/>piercing shrieks and moans. At length, ap&ndash; <pb n="11" type="inWord"/>
