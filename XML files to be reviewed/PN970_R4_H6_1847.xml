            <p>SOME years ago, a fisherman died,<lb/>and left a widow, and a son named<lb/>John. The
                widow had now lost<lb/>her support : and it was thought<lb/>that the boy should go
                to sea. <pb n="4"/>
                <fw type="pagenumber" rend="align(left)">2</fw>
                <fw type="header" rend="align(centre)">THE HONEST CABIN BOY.</fw><lb/> A little
                bundle of clothes was<lb/>made up, and John was soon on<lb/>his way to the
                sea&ndash;beach at Yar&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>mouth. &ldquo; Do you want a
                    cabin&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>boy ?&rdquo; asked John. &ldquo;No, I
                have<lb/>boys enough,&rdquo; said one captain.<lb/>&ldquo;You are too small,&rdquo;
                said another.<lb/>He found that nobody would<lb/>take him. As he could not
                bear<lb/>the thought of going back to his<lb/>mother, he lay down on the
                shore,<lb/>and wept himself to sleep.</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">After some hours the poor boy<lb/>awoke. There
                was not far off the<lb/>captain of a ship that traded to<lb/>St. Petersburg. John
                went up<lb/>to him, and asked if a boy was<lb/>wanted on board his vessel.
                &ldquo;Yes,<lb/>I do want one; but I never take<lb/>boy or man without a
                character.&rdquo;<lb/>John thought for a moment, and <pb n="5"/>

                He<lb/>knew not what to do, when put&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>ting his hand into his
                    jacket&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>pocket, he pulled out his small<lb/>Bible.
                &ldquo; I suppose this will not<lb/>do?&rdquo; said he, as he held it out to<lb/>the
                captain. The captain opened<lb/>it, and saw written on the first<lb/>leaf, &ldquo;
                John R&mdash;&mdash;, given as a<lb/>reward for diligence and good<lb/>conduct at
                his sabbath school.&rdquo;<lb/>&ldquo; Yes, my boy,&rdquo; said the
                captain,<lb/>&ldquo; <hi rend="italic">this will do</hi>; I would rather
                have<lb/>this character than any other.&rdquo;</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">With his little bundle under<lb/>his arm, John
                was soon on the<lb/>ship. For some time the sky was<lb/>bright, and the wind was
                fair.<lb/>But when the vessel got a little<lb/>further a storm came on.
                They<lb/>tried hard to save the ship, but <pb n="6"/>

                began to think that<lb/>the whole of the crew would be<lb/>lost. In the midst of
                their dis&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>tress, John was seen to come on<lb/>deck with his
                school Bible in his<lb/>hand. He then knelt down and<lb/>read the 60th and 61st
                Psalms,<lb/>while the captain and men stood<lb/>around listening to him.</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">God had mercy on those in the<lb/>ship, for
                soon the storm ceased,<lb/>and in due time they got safely<lb/>to St.
                Petersburg.</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">One day while in the Russian<lb/>port, John
                went on shore: it<lb/>was the birthday of one of the<lb/>royal family. The city was
                very<lb/>gay, and rich gentlemen and ladies<lb/>were seen in sledges, or fancy
                cars,<lb/>racing over the ice and snow.<lb/>John was filled with wonder at <pb n="7"/>

                <fw type="pagenumber" rend="align(right)">5</fw><lb/> the fine sight before him.
                While<lb/>looking at it, he saw a bracelet<lb/>fall from the arm of a lady.
                He<lb/>rushed forward to pick it up, and<lb/>called after the owner, but she<lb/>was
                quickly out of sight.</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">John ran to the ship to ask<lb/>what he ought
                to do, when the<lb/>captain said, &ldquo;Why, Jack, your<lb/>fortune is made: these
                are all<lb/>diamonds on the bracelet; I will<lb/>sell them for you when we
                get<lb/>home.&rdquo; &ldquo; But they belong to<lb/>the lady,&rdquo; said he. The
                captain<lb/>replied, &ldquo; Oh, you picked it up,<lb/>and you cannot find the
                lady&mdash;it<lb/>belongs to you.&rdquo; &ldquo; If we should<lb/>have a storm at
                sea, captain, as<lb/>we go back, what would become<lb/>of us?&rdquo; &ldquo;Ah,
                John,&rdquo; said the<lb/>captain, who perhaps was only <pb n="8"/>

                <fw type="header" rend="align(centre)">THE HONEST CABIN BOY.</fw><lb/> trying to see
                if he had got an<lb/>honest cabin&ndash;boy, &ldquo;you are right.<lb/>I will go on
                shore, and try to<lb/>find the owner.&rdquo; After some<lb/>trouble she was found,
                and as a<lb/>reward she gave the boy a large<lb/>sum of money. By the
                captain's<lb/>advice it was laid out in hides<lb/>and furs, which when the
                ship<lb/>came to England were sold for<lb/>nearly double the price they cost.</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">As soon as John landed, he<lb/>set off for his
                mother's cottage.<lb/>But when he got to it, he found<lb/>it shut up, and the grass
                was<lb/>growing about the door. &ldquo; Oh,&rdquo;<lb/>thought he, &ldquo; my poor
                mother<lb/>has died of want!&rdquo; He looked<lb/>about him in the greatest
                grief,<lb/>when he heard some one call to<lb/>him. &ldquo; John, is that you

                who<lb/>spoke to him. She then told<lb/>him that his poor mother had<lb/>gone into
                the workhouse.</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">John was soon at the work&ndash;<lb

                said the<lb/>porter. &ldquo; I want my mother,&rdquo;<lb/>said John. The porter said
                she<lb/>must not go out without an<lb/>order; but John went in, fell<lb/>on his
                mother's neck, then put&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>ting her arm under his arm,
                he<lb/>marched out with her on the way<lb/>to the old cottage. There he saw<lb/>her
                placed in comfort, and leaving<lb/>her some money to keep her while<lb/>he was gone
                on another voyage,<lb/>he went again to his ship. It is<lb/>said that John was a
                pious son<lb/>to his mother from that day, and <pb n="10"/>

                made<lb/>him kind to his mother ; and<lb/>we hope, it led him to know our<lb/>Lord
                Jesus Christ as his Saviour,<lb/>young reader : this holy book<lb/>speaks to you. It
                directs you<lb/>to repent, and to forsake all sin.<lb/>It points you to Jesus, the
