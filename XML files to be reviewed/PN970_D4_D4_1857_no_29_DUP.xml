                pleasantly,<lb/>&ldquo;And what shall the story be about?&rdquo;<lb/>&ldquo; Oh,
                about something that happened to<lb/>you when you were a boy, uncle&mdash;a
                real,<lb/>true story.&rdquo; &ldquo; I think that kind is always<lb/>the
                nicest,&rdquo; said a sweet, gentle&ndash;looking<lb/>little girl. An expression of
                sorrow passed<lb/>over the old man's face; then, after<lb/>a pause, he said :
                &ldquo; Well, children, I <hi rend="italic">will</hi><lb/>tell you something that
                happened to me in<lb/>my youth ; it was that which brought<lb/>these gray hairs
                before their time, and<lb/>robbed me of the joy of youth for ever.</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">&ldquo; I once had a sister. She was a
                sweet,<lb/>loving child ; timid and retiring, and of a<lb/>most yielding
                disposition, except where<lb/>right and wrong were concerned, and then<lb/>her
                firmness was remarkable in one so<lb/>young. I loved her better than anything<lb/>in
                the world, though I was exactly her<lb/>opposite in all respects Headstrong
                and<lb/>impetuous, irritable and passionate, while<lb/>my dear mother lived it was

                <fw type="header" rend="align(centre)">ANGER.</fw><lb/> love for her could do to
                keep me even in<lb/>partial restraint; but about three years<lb/>before, she had
                died, leaving Lucy, myself,<lb/>and an infant brother, under the care of<lb/>an
                uncle. This uncle, though I believe a<lb/>good man, and sincerely desirous of
                doing<lb/>his duty towards us, had yet but little<lb/>influence over me, for I was
                always more<lb/>easily influenced by love than by harsh&ndash;<lb type="inWord"
                />ness.</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">&ldquo; Like most boys, I was fond of
                fishing,<lb/>and I had a fine opportunity for enjoying<lb/>this pastime. At the foot
                of my uncle's<lb/>garden was a very large pond, plentifully<lb/>stocked with fish ;
                here I was permitted<lb/>to amuse myself at liberty, with but one<lb/>restriction.
                There was a certain part of<lb/>the pond where Lucy and I had been<lb/>forbidden to
                go ; my uncle had marked it<lb/>by putting a few stakes at each end of
                the<lb/>place. This idea vexed me extremely, for<lb/>boys about twelve years old do
                not like to<lb/>have it supposed that they cannot take<lb/>care of themselves.</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">&ldquo;Lucy was generally my
                companion<lb/>while fishing: not that she liked it, for <pb n="5"/>

                <fw type="pagenumber" rend="align(right)">5</fw><lb/> she sometimes betrayed an
                unwillingness<lb/>to accompany me, which, compared with<lb/>her delight in being
                with me on every<lb/>other occasion, and her desire to please<lb/>me, might have
                shown me, had I chosen<lb/>to see it, how much she disliked it.</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">&ldquo; One afternoon, I took my rod,
                and<lb/>called to Lucy to put on her bonnet, and<lb/>come. I think she was not very well<lb/>

                if I didn't<lb/>go with you to&ndash;day ?&rsquo; I looked at her<lb/>surprised.
                &lsquo; Not mind,&rsquo; I interrupted,<lb/>&lsquo; why, of course you know I want
                your<lb/>help, Lucy ; but if you choose to be ill&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>natured
                about it, I don't care ; you may<lb/>stay at home.&rsquo; And I turned
                abruptly<lb/>away, and walked off, pretty sure, how&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>ever,
                that Lucy would not be far behind<lb/>me. I was right. A minute after, I<lb/>heard
                the patter of little feet upon the<lb/>garden walk, and she was by my side.</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">&ldquo;We walked on in silence, and when
                we<lb/>arrived at the pond, I baited my hook, and<lb/>threw it into the water. But
                it was a<lb/>bad day for fishing ; and after waiting a<lb/>long time, I grew tired
                and impatient. I<lb/>felt cross and irritable ; angry with my&ndash;<lb
                    type="inWord"/>self&mdash;angry too with Lucy : for there is<lb/>nothing
                irritates one more against a per&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>son, than a sense of
                having injured them.</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">&ldquo; Just about the middle of the spot
                we<lb/>had been forbidden, and standing a little<lb/>way out in the water, was a
                large tree<lb/>whose spreading branches cast a deep<lb/>shadow all around it. I had
                often looked <pb n="7"/>

                longing&mdash;it was so<lb/>admirably adapted for fishing; but had<lb/>never yet
                seriously thought of disobeying<lb/>my uncle's express commands. Now,<lb/>however, I
                was in no mood to withstand<lb/>temptation. I paused but one moment<lb/>after the
                idea presented itself&mdash;the next I<lb/>was within the boundary stakes.
                Without<lb/>stopping to think, I threw the line, and<lb/>the hook catching on one of
                the trees, the<lb/>rod was jerked out of my hands, and to<lb/>my horror I saw it
                hanging just out of my<lb/>reach. I looked at it fur a moment in<lb/>consternation,
                then an idea struck me.<lb/>Hastily feeling in my pockets, I pulled<lb/>out a ball
                of twine ; then picking up a<lb/>stone which lay at my feet, I tied it to
                the<lb/>end of the cord.</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">&ldquo; Seeing I would need some help in
                my<lb/>endeavours to get at the rod, I glanced<lb/>round for Lucy. She was standing
                just<lb/>outside the stakes, gazing at me with a<lb/>look of surprise and terror
                which I shall<lb/>never forget. &lsquo; Lucy,&rsquo; I called out, &lsquo;I<lb/>want
                you to help me ; come quick?&rsquo; She<lb/>did not move, and I called again,

                Arthur.&rsquo;<lb/>Her reply sounded so calm that it irritated<lb/>me more than
                ever. &lsquo; But you must<lb/>come, Lucy. You shall help me,&rsquo; I ex&ndash;<lb

                passionately. &lsquo; No, Arthur.&rsquo; Oh,<lb/>I knew not what I did ; but lifting
                the<lb/>hand that still held the stone, with all my<lb/>force I hurled it at her. I
                cannot tell<lb/>what followed. I remember seeing her<lb/>fall&mdash;a little coffin
                in a darkened room,<lb/>kissing clay&ndash;cold lips that had never,<lb/>never
                spoken one harsh word, and a new&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>made grave. &lsquo; No
                tears for her :&rsquo; her eyes<lb/>had seen the King in his beauty ; her
