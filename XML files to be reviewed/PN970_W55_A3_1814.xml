            <p rend="first-indent(2)">THE renowned Pepin, king of France, had<lb/>a sister named Bellisant, who was
                exceedingly<lb/>beautiful, and whose hand was demanded in<lb/>marriage by several
                kings and princes. The<lb/>lady Bellisant's choice fell on Alexander, empe<lb
                    type="inWord"/>ror of Constantinople, who came to the court of<lb/>king Pepin to
                espouse the princess. Great<lb/>rejoicings were made on the occasion
                throughout<lb/>France; and shortly after the marriage, the em&ndash;<lb type="inWord"
                />peror took leave of king Pepin, and conducted<lb/>his lovely bride with great pomp
                and triumph to<lb/>the city of Constantinople.</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2)">The emperor's prime minister and greatest<lb/>favorite was an arch priest, a selfish
                and cruel<lb/>man, who completely governed the emperor, and<lb/>tyrannized over his
                subjects. The arch priest<lb/>observing the gentleness and sweetness of the<lb/>new
                empress, began to fear that she would acquire<lb/>too much influence over the
                emperor, and<lb/>wickedly resolved to seek the destruction of the<lb/>innocent lady.
                The emperor was of a credulous<lb/>and suspicious temper, and the arch priest
                soon

            <fw type="header" rend="align(centre)">THE ADVENTURES OF</fw><lb/>
            found means to infuse into his mind suspicions<lb/>of the empress. One day when the
                emperor<lb/>was alone, the arch priest entered the apartment<lb/>and, prostrating
                himself at the emperor's feet,<lb/>said, &ldquo;High and mighty king, may heaven
                guard<lb/>your majesty from the base attempts of the wick&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>ed and
                treacherous! I am a holy priest and may<lb/>not seek the death of any man; nor may I
                re&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>veal the name of the criminal who has intrusted<lb/>to me,
                in the way of confession, a dreadful secret;<lb/>but, in the most solemn manner, I
                conjure your<lb/>majesty to beware of the designs of your em&ndash;<lb type="inWord"
                />press; for that beautiful and dissembling lady<lb/>is faithless and disloyal, and
                even now is plan&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>ning your death. O mighty emperor! my
                heart<lb/>swells with indignation, to think that a lady so<lb/>unparalleled in
                beauty and wisdom, and the<lb/>sister of a great king, should become so dishon&ndash;<lb
                    type="inWord"/>orable and wicked.&rdquo;</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2)">The emperor, giving implicit faith to the arch<lb/>priest's tale, could no longer
                restrain his fury;<lb/>and abruptly leaving the arch priest, he rushed<lb/>into the
                apartment of the empress, and in the most<lb/>fierce, rude, and unmanly manner,
                dragged the<lb/>fair Bellisant about the chamber by her long and<lb/>beautiful
                hair.</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2)">&ldquo;Alas! my dear lord,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;what moves<lb/>you to this
                outrage?&rdquo;</p>

            <p rend="firstindent(2)">&ldquo;Base despicable wretch!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;I<lb/>am but too well
                informed of your infamous pro<lb type="inWord"/>ceedings;&ldquo; then dashing her
                with violence<lb/>against the ground, he left her speechless.</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2)">The attendants of the empress finding her<lb/>bleeding and senseless upon the floor,
                uttered<lb/>loud screams, which presently brought all the<lb/>nobles of the court
                into the chamber of the em&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>press. Every one pitied the sufferings
                of their<lb/>amiable queen; and the state councellors de&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>manded an
                audience of the emperor, to represent<lb/>to him the wrongs he had done to an
                honorable<lb/>lady, in whom no one had ever perceived a fault.<lb/>But the emperor
                was mad with passion, which<lb/>the arch priest continued artfully to
                inflame,<lb/>and to the reprehensions of his state councellors,<lb/>he answered,
                &ldquo;Let no man presume to defend her<lb/>who has basely betrayed me. She shall
                die;<lb/>and they who interfere in her behalf shall par&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>take the
                dreadful punishment that awaits this<lb/>wretched and disloyal woman.&rdquo;</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2)">The empress being recovered from her swoon,<lb/>then fell on her knees, and,
                with tears, thus ad&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>dressed the emperor:</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2)">&ldquo;Alas! my lord, take pity on one who never<lb/>harbored an evil thought against
                your person or<lb/>dignity. I shall soon become a mother, and I<lb/>implore your
                compassion in behalf of my child.

            <p rend="first-indent(2)">The hard&ndash;hearted emperor, bewitched with<lb/>the false tales of the
                insidious priest, answered,<lb/>&ldquo;Perish thou and thy child, basest of
                women!<lb/>Thy child will be to me no joy, but rather great<lb/>dishonor.&rdquo;</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2)">The courtiers, perceiving nothing could miti&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>gate the rage of the

                good king Pepin. Innocent and noble lady, fol&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>low my counsel; far
                if you stay here, the em&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>peror will bring you to a shameful
                death.&rdquo;</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2)">&ldquo;No, Blandiman,&rdquo; the queen replied, &ldquo;I must<lb/>not follow thy
                advice: should I steal privately<lb/>from the court, it might be said I had fled
                know&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>ing myself to be guilty. Believe me, I had rath&ndash;<lb

                which I am innocent.&rdquo;</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2)">The emperor still loving his queen, could not<lb/>bring himself to pronounce the
                sentence of her<lb/>execution; yet as the base arch priest continu&ndash;<lb type="inWord"
                />ally irritated his mind with false accusations<lb/>against her, he resolved to
                banish her from his<lb/>dominions, and immediately commanded her to<lb/>quit
                Constantinople. At the same time he pub&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>lished an edict forbidding
                all persons on pain of<lb/>death, to assist or succour the unfortunate
                lady,<lb/>allowing her no other attendant than her servant<lb/>Blandiman, whom she
                had brought with her<lb/>from France.</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2)">Sentence being thus pronounced, the queen<lb/>and Blandiman hastened away. As she
                passed<lb/>through the city, she was met by multitudes of<lb/>people, lamenting the

                Her faithful attendant<lb/>gathered the fallen leaves and the moss to make<lb/>a

                into a swoon near the mouth<lb/>of the cave into which the bear had borne
                her<lb/>infant.</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2)">It happened that king Pepin, accompanied by<lb/>several great lords and barons of his

            child, who opened his eyes as the king stood<lb/>gazing on him, and smiling,
                stretched out his<lb/>little arms, as if to ask protection.</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2)">&ldquo;See, my lord,&rdquo; said king Pepin, &ldquo;this lovely<lb/>infant appears to
                solicit my favor. Here is no<lb/>one to claim it, and I will adopt it for my
                own.&rdquo;<lb/>The king little imagined it was his nephew, the<lb/>son of his
                sister Bellisant, that he now delivered<lb/>into the hands of one of his pages, who
                took the<lb/>babe to Orleans to be nursed, and gave it, by the<lb/>king's order, the
                name of Valentine.</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2)">Scarcely had the page rode away with the<lb/>child when the king met Blandiman, and
                    de&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>manded with great surprise, what news
                from<lb/>Constantinople. Blandiman, bending one knee<lb/>to the ground, began to
                relate the disasters of<lb/>the empress; but upon king Pepin's hearing that<lb/>the
                arch priest had accused her of plotting<lb/>the emperor's death, he flew into the
                most<lb/>violent rage against his innocent sister, and said,<lb/>&ldquo;Now, by
                heaven, I cannot believe the royal arch<lb/>priest would bring a false accusation
                against<lb/>any one, and I blame the emperor for sparing<lb/>the life of his
                treacherous, disloyal queen: but<lb/>let her beware how she comes within my

            <p rend="first-indent(2)">Blandiman, with a heavy heart, searched the<lb/>forest for his injured mistress, and
                at length he<lb/>espied her on the ground, tearing her dishevelled<lb/>hair and
                uttering piercing cries of grief. &ldquo;Ah!<lb/>Blandiman,&rdquo; she exclaimed,
                &ldquo;can there exist in<lb/>the world a being more encompassed with grief<lb/>and
                sorrow? But an hour since I was the joy&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>ful mother of two
                beautiful babes. A ravenous<lb/>bear snatched one from my arms, and some
                other<lb/>cruel beast of prey has doubtless devoured<lb/>the other. At the foot of
                yonder tree I left it<lb/>when I pursued the bear; but no traces of either<lb/>of my
                children remain. They are gone! gone<lb/>forever; and I, wretched mother, have
                nothing<lb/>left but to die. Go, Blandiman, leave me here to<lb/>perish, and tell
                the mighty emperor of Constan&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>tinople to what a horrible fate he,
                by listening to<lb/>evil counsel, has destined his innocent wife
                and<lb/>children.&rdquo;</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2)">Blandiman would not quit the unfortunate<lb/>queen; and when she became more calm, he

                religion.</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2)">The bear that had carried away the infant,<lb/>bore it to her cave, and laid it
                down unhurt be&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>fore her young ones. The cubs, however, did<lb/>not
                devour it; but stroked it with their rough<lb/>paws: and the old bear, perceiving
                their kindness<lb/>for the little babe, gave it suck, and nourished it<lb/>in this
                manner for the space of a whole year.</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2)">The child became hardy and robust, and as he<lb/>grew in strength, began to range the
                forest, and<lb/>attack the wild beasts with such fury that they<lb/>used to shun the
                cave where he continued to live<lb/>with the old bear, who loved him with
                extreme<lb/>fondness. He passed this kind of life during<lb/>eighteen years, growing
                to such wonderful<lb/>strength that he was the terror of the neigh<lb type="inWord"
                />boring country. The name of Orson was given<lb/>him, because he had been nursed by
                a bear; and<lb/>the renown of the wild man spread over all<lb/>France. He went
                naked; and uttered no other<lb/>sounds than a wild kind of a howl, to
                express<lb/>either his anger or his joy.</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2)">King Pepin often entertained a great desire to<lb/>see the wild man of the woods; and
                one day rode<lb/>with his retinue into the forest of Orleans, in<lb/>hopes of
                meeting him. The king, leaving his

                On hearing<lb/>the sound of the horse's feet, the wild man rush&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>ed
                upon the king, and would have strangled him<lb/>in an instant, but for a valiant
                knight, who gal&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>loped up and wounded Orson with his
                sword.<lb/>Orson then quitted the king, and, running furi&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>ously
                upon the <choice><orig>night</orig><corr>knight</corr></choice>, caught him in his arms,<lb/>and overthrew him and his horse. The
                king<lb/>being quite unarmed, could not assist the knight,<lb/>but rode away to call
                the attendants to his res&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>cue. However, before they arrived on the
                spot,<lb/>the unfortunate knight was torn into pieces, and<lb/>Orson had fled into
                the thickest part of the for&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>est, where all their endeavours could
                not discov&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>er him. The noise of this adventure increased<lb/>every
                one's terror of the wild man, and the<lb/>neighboring villages were nearly abandoned
                by<lb/>their inhabitants.</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2)">Valentine, in the mean while, had been<lb/>educated in all kinds of accomplishments
                with<lb/>the king's fair daughter Eglantine. Nothing<lb/>could exceed the fondness
                of the young people<lb/>for each other. Indeed, there never was a<lb/>lovlier
                princess than Eglantine, or a more<lb/>brave and accomplished cavalier than
                Valentine.<lb/>The king, observing his inclination for arms, in<lb type="inWord"

            him a command in the army that was preparing<lb/>a march against the Saracens.</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2)">Valentine soon distinguished himself above all<lb/>other leaders in battle. He fought
                near the<lb/>king's side; and when his majesty was taken by<lb/>a troop of the
                Pagans, Valentine rushed through<lb/>their ranks, slew hundreds of them, and
                    replac&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>ing the king on his horse, led him off in
                triumph.<lb/>Afterwards, when the Saracen city was besieg&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>ed, he
                was the first to scale the walls, and place<lb/>the Christian standard on the
                battlements. By<lb/>this means, a complete victory was obtained, and<lb/>peace
                restored to France.</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2)">Valentine, having conquered the Saracens,<lb/>returned to the court of king Pepin,
                and was<lb/>received with loud acclamations by the people,<lb/>and joyfully welcomed
                by the princess Eg&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>lantine. The distinctions and favors
                showered<lb/>on him, raised the envy and hatred of Henry and<lb/>Haufray, the king's
                sons, who plotted together<lb/>to destroy Valentine. The same day king
                Pepin<lb/>presented Valentine to his nobles, saying, &ldquo;My<lb/>lords, this brave
                youth saved my life, and rescu&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>ed his country from the Saracens: I
                therefore<lb/>now create him earl of Clerimont.&rdquo; Haufray and<lb/>Henry were
                more and more irritated against Val&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>entine by this new and
                honorable distinction, and

            they determined to watch closely for some op&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>portunity of effecting
                his destruction.</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2)">It happened very shortly after the return of<lb/>Valentine from his victory over the
                Saracens,<lb/>that a petition was presented to the king by a<lb/>deputation of
                peasants, praying relief against<lb/>Orson, the wild man of the woods; the fear
                of<lb/>whom was now become so great that the peasants<lb/>dared not go out to till
                their fields, nor the shep&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>herds to watch their flocks. The king
                    immedi&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>ately issued a proclamation, saying, if any
                man<lb/>would undertake to bring Orson, alive or dead,<lb/>to the city, he should
                receive a thousand marks<lb/>of gold.</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2)">&ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; said Henry, &ldquo;I think no person is so<lb/>proper to
                undertake this enterprise as the found&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>ling Valentine, on whom
                your majesty lavishes<lb/>such great favor. Perhaps, if he conquers the<lb/>naked
                savage with his sword, you will not think<lb/>it too much to reward him with the
                hand of our<lb/>sister Eglantine.&rdquo;</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2)">To this the king replied with a frown, &ldquo;Away!<lb/>for thy speech betrays thy
                envy.&rdquo;</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2)">Valentine, fixing a stern look on the malicious<lb/>brother, said, &ldquo;You give
                this counsel to encom&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>pass my death. Be it so. Know that I
                will<lb/>not fail of victory here also. I will go without<lb/>delay, and alone, to
                conquer the savage man.&rdquo;</p>

            <p rend="first-indent(2)">&ldquo;No, Valentine,&rdquo; said the king; &ldquo;you shall<lb/>not rush upon
                destruction to gratify the ill will<lb/>of evil minded persons.&rdquo;</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2)">&ldquo;Pardon me, my liege,&rdquo; replied Valentine:<lb/>&ldquo;it concerns my honor
                that I go, I will encoun&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>ter this danger, and every other, rather
                than not<lb/>prove myself worthy of your majesty's favor and<lb/>protection.
                To&ndash;morrow morning I will depart<lb/>for the forest at the break of
                day.&rdquo;</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2)">When the princess Eglantine heard of Valen&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>tine's determination,
                she sought to divert him<lb/>from his purpose; but finding him inflexibly re<lb
                    type="inWord"/>solved to attack the wild man, she adorned him<lb/>with a scarf
                embroidered with her own hands,<lb/>and then retired to her chamber, to pray for
                his<lb/>safety.</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2)">At the first dawn of morning, Valentine arose;<lb/>and putting on his armour, having
                his shield<lb/>polished like a mirror, he departed for the for<lb type="inWord"
                />est; and being arrived there he alighted, and,<lb/>tying his horse to a tree,
                penetrated into the<lb/>thickest part of the wood in search of Orson.<lb/>He
                wandered about a long time in vain; and<lb/>being come near the mouth of a large
                cave, he<lb/>thought that might be the hiding place of the<lb/>wild man. Valentine
                then climbed up a high<lb/>tree near the cave; and scarcely was he seated

            among the branches when he heard Orson's roar<lb/>in the forest.</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2)">Orson had been hunting, and came with a<lb/>swift pace, bearing a buck, he had
                killed, upon<lb/>his shoulders. Valentine could not help admir&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>ing
                the beauty of his person, the grace and free&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>dom of his motions,
                and his appearance of<lb/>strength and agility. He felt a species of affec<lb
                    type="inWord"/>tion for the wild man, and wished it was possible<lb/>to tame him
                without having recourse to weapons.</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2)">Valentine now tore off a branch of the tree,<lb/>and threw it at Orson's feet; who
                looked up and<lb/>espying Valentine in the tree, uttered a howl of<lb/>fury, and
                darted up the tree like lightning. Val&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>entine as quickly descended
                on the other side.<lb/>Orson seeing him on the ground, leaped down,<lb/>and, opening
                his arms, prepared, in his usual<lb/>manner, to rush upon and overthrow his
                    antago&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>nist; but Valentine holding up a polished<lb/>shield,
                Orson suddenly beheld, instead of the<lb/>person he meant to seize, his own naked,
                wild,<lb/>and terror&ndash;striking figure. Upon Valentine's<lb/>lowering the
                shield, he again saw his enemy,<lb/>and with a cry of transport again prepared
                to<lb/>grasp him in his arms. The strength of Orson<lb/>was so very great, that
                Valentine was unable to<lb/>defend himself without having recourse to his<lb/>sword.
                When Orson received a wound from the

                instantly tearing up by the roots a<lb/>large tree, furiously attacked
                Valentine.</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2)">A dreadful fight now ensued between these<lb/>two brothers, and the victory was a
                long time<lb/>doubtful: Orson receiving many dreadful wounds<lb/>from the sword of
                Valentine, and Valentine with<lb/>great difficulty escaped from being crushed
                to<lb/>death beneath the weighty club of Orson. Just<lb/>at this time the bear who
                had nursed Orson, and<lb/>who was now in the cave, hearing his cries of<lb/>rage,
                came out to see what was the matter with<lb/>her favorite. Valentine perceiving her
                approach,<lb/>aimed a blow at her with his sword, which<lb/>would probably have
                killed her on the spot, had<lb/>not Orson rushed forward, and throwing one<lb/>arm
                round the neck of the bear, he with the<lb/>other hand supplicated for mercy for his
                old and<lb/>only friend. Valentine was greatly affected<lb/>with this generous
                action, and, laying aside his<lb/>sword, made signs that he would not hurt
                the<lb/>bear; and in token of kindness brought some<lb/>grapes, and a little bottle
                of strong liquor, which<lb/>he had deposited near for his own refreshment<lb/>in
                case of need, and presented them to Orson.</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2)">Orson no sooner tasted the delicious flavor of<lb/>the fruit, than he gave it to the

                death; and soon after<lb/>testifying her love of Orson in the manner we<lb/>have
                described, she faintly howled, and fell<lb/>dead on the ground.</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2)">Orson stood for a few moments motionless with<lb/>alarm and amazement: then supposing
                his an&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>cient friend might be only asleep, he stooped
                and<lb/>endeavoured to rouse her; but finding all his<lb/>efforts ineffectual, his

                not venture to return. A great feast was<lb/>in preparation, and there were plenty

                pieces.</p>

                permitted him to be brought in: and<lb/>the whole court soon gathered in a crowd in
                the<lb/>apartment, and were much amused by his wild<lb/>actions and gestures,
                although very cautious<lb/>not to come near to him. On Valentine's mak<lb

                princess Eglantine; for Orson had<lb/>now become so attached to Valentine that
                he<lb/>would obey him in all things, but would suffer<lb/>no other person to attempt
                to control him. If<lb/>Valentine went for a moment out of his sight,<lb/>he would
                utter cries of distress, and over&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>turn every one that stood in the

            <p rend="first-indent(2)">Valentine approached the shield; but, in spite<lb/>of all his efforts, he could not
                loosen it from the<lb/>tree, though it appeared to hang but on a slender<lb/>branch.
                Valentine, breathless with his exertions<lb/>to pull down the shield, stood leaning
                against the<lb/>tree, when Agramont, with a loud laugh exclaim&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>ed,
                &ldquo;Fly and save thyself, fair knight; for, since<lb/>thou canst not move the
                shield, thou art not<lb/>destined to be my victor. Further, know, there<lb/>is no
                one living who can subdue me, except he be<lb/>the son of a mighty king, and yet was
                suckled by<lb/>a wild beast.&rdquo; Valentine started on hearing<lb/>these latter
                words, and ran to Orson, who had<lb/>been all this time employed in gazing with
                looks<lb/>of delight and admiration on the beautiful lady<lb/>Fezon. Valentine led

                the<lb/>green knight trembled and turned pale; then<lb/>gnashing his teeth, he
                seized his sword, and<lb/>attacked Orson with desperate fury. At the<lb/>first blow
                Agramont's trusty sword broke in<lb/>pieces upon the enchanted shield. Next

                would have instantly destroy&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>ed him, had not Valentine interposed
                to save his<lb/>life. Orson continued to hold him down till<lb/>some chains were
                brought; when, in despite of<lb/>the furious struggles of the green knight,
                Orson<lb/>bound him in fetters to lead him away a prisoner.</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2)">Agramont, finding himself entirely subdued,<lb/>addressed himself to Valentine, and
                said, &ldquo;This<lb/>savage man is my conqueror; therefore there<lb/>must be some

                Valentine having despatched a<lb/>herald to acquaint the duke of Aquitain

                Pacolet mounted into the<lb/>air on his winged horse, and was presently out<lb/>of
                sight. Valentine now fell upon the bosom of<lb/>his brother Orson, and Orson upon
                his: they<lb/>embraced each other with the utmost affection,<lb/>and joyfully
                proceeded towards France.</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2)">While these transactions were passing, the<lb/>emperor of Constantinople had lived in
                great<lb/>affliction for the loss of his queen. The wicked<lb/>arch priest continued
                to represent her as the<lb/>vilest of women, and to abuse the emperor's con<lb

            <p rend="first-indent(2)">Nothing could exceed the emperor's grief.<lb/>He immediately set out with all his
                nobles for<lb/>France, to implore king Pepin to assist him in<lb/>searching for the
                injured Bellisant. In every<lb/>town on his journey he caused her innocence
                to<lb/>be proclaimed, and offered an immense reward<lb/>to any one who should bring
