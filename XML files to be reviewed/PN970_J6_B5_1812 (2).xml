                before his father, related<lb/>the circumstances as they had<lb/>really happened,
                and entreated<lb/>forgiveness with tears and sobs.<lb/>His father was too
                indignant<lb/>to speak. George, touched to<lb/>the quick to see the distress
                of<lb/>one he had so dearly loved,<lb/>threw his arms around his<lb/>neck, saying,
