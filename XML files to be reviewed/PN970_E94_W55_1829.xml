                    and<lb/>spirits, were at play at blindman's&ndash;buff. It<lb/>was Lucy's

                    her<lb/>Mamma to invite some of her young friends<lb/>to tea. The favourite game
                    of blindman's&ndash;buff<lb/>lasted for some time; and at length, tired

                        Thorn&ndash;bushes.</hi><lb/>&swell;</head>
                <lb/>
                <p rend="align(justify)">Mr. Thomson and his son Alfred were one<lb/>evening, in the
                    month of May, sitting at the<lb/>foot of a delightful hill, and surveying
                    the<lb/>beautiful works of nature that surrounded<lb/>them. The declining sun,
                    now sinking into<lb/>the west, seemed to clothe every thing with a<lb/>purple
                    robe. The cheerful song of a shepherd<lb/>called off their attention from their
                    meditations<lb/>on those delightful prospects. This shepherd<lb/>was driving
                    home his flock from the adjacent<lb/>fields.</p>
                <p rend="align(justify) first-indent(3)">Thorn&ndash;bushes grew on each side of the
                    road,<lb/>and every sheep that approached the thorns was<lb/>sure to be robbed
                    of some part of its wool,<lb/>which much displeased little Alfred. &ldquo;
                    Only<lb/>see, Papa,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo; how the sheep are de&ndash;<lb
                        type="inWord"/>prived of their wool by those bushes ! You<lb/>have often
                    told me that God makes nothing in<lb/>vain; but these briars seem only made for
                        <pb n="35"/>
                    <fw type="header" rend="align(centre)">ALFRED.</fw>
                    <fw type="pagenumber" rend="align(right)">33</fw>
                    <lb/>mischief : people should therefore join to de&ndash;<lb type="inWord"
                    />stroy them root and branch. Were the poor<lb/>sheep to come often this way,
                    they would be<lb/>robbed of all their clothing. But that shall not<lb/>be the
                    case, for I will rise with the sun to&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>morrow morning,
                    and with my little bill&ndash;hook<lb/>and snip&ndash;snap, I will level all
                    these briars with<lb/>the ground. You may come with me, Papa, if<lb/>you please,
                    and bring with you an axe. Before<lb/>breakfast, we shall be able to destroy
                    them all.&rdquo;</p>
                <p rend="align(justify) first-indent(3)">Mr. Thomson replied, &ldquo; We must not
                    go<lb/>about this business in too great a hurry, but<lb/>take a little time to
                    consider of it; perhaps<lb/>there may not be so much cause for being
                    angry<lb/>with these bushes, as you at present seem to<lb/>imagine. Have you not
                    seen the shepherds<lb/>about Lammas with great sheers in their hands,<lb/>take
                    from the trembling sheep all their wool,<lb/>not being contented with a few
                    locks only?&rdquo;</p>
                <p rend="align(justify) first-indent(3)">Alfred allowed that was true; but they
                    did<lb/>it in order to make clothes ; whereas the hedges<lb/>robbed the sheep
                    without having the least<lb/>occasion for their wool, and evidently for
                    no<lb/>useful purpose.</p>

                <lb/>
                <p rend="align(justify) first-indent(3)">Mr. Thomson allowed the arguments of
                    little<lb/>Alfred to be just; for nature has given to<lb/>every beast a
                    clothing, and we are obliged from<lb/>them to borrow our own, otherwise we
                    should<lb/>be forced to go naked, and exposed to the in&ndash;<lb type="inWord"
                    />clemency of the elements.</p>
                <p rend="align(justify) first-indent(3)">&ldquo; Very well, Papa,&rdquo; said
                    Alfred, &ldquo; though<lb/>they want clothing, yet these bushes want none
                    :<lb/>they rob us of what we have need, and there&ndash;<lb/>fore down they
                    shall all come with to&ndash;morrow<lb/>morning's rising sun. And, I dare say,
                    Papa,<lb/>you will come along: with me, and assist me.&rdquo;</p>
                <p rend="align(justify) first-indent(3)">Mr. Thomson could not but consent,
                    and<lb/>little Alfred thought himself nothing less than<lb/>Alexander, merely
                    from the expectation of<lb/>destroying at once this formidable band
                    of<lb/>robbers. He could hardly sleep, being so much<lb/>taken up with the idea
                    of his victories, to<lb/>which the morrow's sun was to be witness.</p>
                <p rend="align(justify) first-indent(3)">The cheerful lark had hardly begun to
                        pro&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>claim the approach of morning, when
                    Alfred<lb/>got up, and ran to awaken his Papa, Although<lb/>Mr. Thomson was very
                    indifferent concerning<lb/>the fate of the thorn&ndash;bushes, yet he was not
                        <pb n="37"/>
                    <fw type="header" rend="align(centre)">ALFRED.</fw>
                    <fw type="pagenumber" rend="align(right)">35</fw>
                    <lb/>displeased with having the opportunity of shew&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>ing
                    to his son Alfred the beauties of the rising<lb/>sun. They dressed themselves
                    immediately,<lb/>took the necessary instruments, and set out on<lb/>this
                    important expedition.</p>
                <p rend="align(justify) first-indent(3)">When they came near to the bushes,
                    they<lb/>observed a multitude of little birds flying in and<lb/>out of them, and
                    fluttering their wings from<lb/>branch to branch. On seeing this, Mr.
                        Thom&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>son stopped his son, and desired him to
                        sus&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>pend his vengeance a little time, that
                    they<lb/>might not disturb those innocent birds. With<lb/>this view they retired
                    to the foot of the hill<lb/>where they had sat the preceding evening,
                    and<lb/>from thence examined more particularly what<lb/>had occasioned this
                    apparent bustle among the<lb/>birds. From hence they plainly saw, that
                    they<lb/>were employed in carrying away those bits of<lb/>wool in their beaks,
                    which the bushes had torn<lb/>from the sheep the evening before. There<lb/>came
                    a multitude of different sorts of birds,<lb/>who loaded themselves with the
                    plunder.</p>
                <p rend="align(justify) first-indent(3)">Alfred was quite astonished at this
                    sight,<lb/>and asked his father what could be the meaning <pb n="38"/>
                    <fw type="pagenumber">36</fw>
                    <fw type="header" rend="align(centre)">ALFRED.</fw>
                    <lb/>of it. &ldquo; You by this plainly see,&rdquo; replied Mr,<lb/>Thomson,
                    &ldquo; that Providence provides for crea&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>tures of
                    every class, and furnishes them with<lb/>all things necessary for their
                    convenience <choice>
                        <orig>aud</orig>
                        <corr>and</corr>
                    </choice><lb/>preservation. Here, you see, the poor birds<lb/>find what is
                    necessary for their habitations,<lb/>wherein they are to nurse and rear their
                    young,<lb/>and with this they make a comfortable bed for<lb/>themselves and
                    their little progeny. The in&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>nocent thorn&ndash;bush,
                    against which you yesterday<lb/>so loudly exclaimed, is of infinite service to
                    the<lb/>inhabitants of the air ; it takes from those that<lb/>are rich only what
                    they can very well spare, in<lb/>order to satisfy the wants of the poor.
                    Have<lb/>you now any wish to cut those bushes down ?&rdquo;</p>
                <p rend="align(justify) first-indent(3)">Alfred shook his head, and said he would
                    not<lb/>cut the bushes down for the world. Mr. Thomson<lb/>applauded his son for
                    so saying ; and, after<lb/>enjoying the sweets of the morning, they
                    retired<lb/>home to breakfast, leaving the bushes to flourish<lb/>in peace.</p>
