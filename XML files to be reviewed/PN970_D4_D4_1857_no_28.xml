                world with her blind child. And she<lb/>must work diligently with her needle
                for<lb/>her living ; but that she did not mind.<lb/>Sometimes she did not come home
                for the<lb/>whole day, for she had to go to work for<lb/>strangers from early
                morning until late in<lb/>the evening ; and all that time the blind<lb/>child was
                alone. But good Martha, the<lb/>old woman who lived over the way, came<lb/>several
                times, in the course of the day, to<lb/>look after little Paul. But then she
                could<lb/>not stay with him long. &ldquo; Munter,&rdquo; a<lb/>little
                puppy&ndash;dog, and Bibi, a dear little<lb/>canary&ndash;bird, staid with him all
                the while.<lb/>The canary&ndash;bird used to sing him its<lb/>sweetest songs ; and
                when the little boy<lb/>let his hand hang down over the side of<lb/>the bed, Munter
                would run up and lick<lb/>it ; when Paul wanted to get up, this<lb/>same sensible
                Munter would take hold of<lb/>his little coat&ndash;sleeve, and lead him up
                and<lb/>down the room, that he should not run<lb/>against a table or a chair.</p>

            <p rend="first-indent(3) align(justify)">The happiest time for the little boy
                was<lb/>the evening, when his mother came home.<lb/>She used to tell him, while she
                sewed<lb/>away as fast as she could, of the blessed&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>ness of
                heaven, and of the good God and<lb/>all the holy angels ; and she
                entertained<lb/>him with beautiful stories until late&mdash;un&ndash;<lb
                    type="inWord"/>til he shut his eyes for very weariness.<lb/>&ldquo; When we get
                to heaven,&rdquo; she said some&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>times, &ldquo; the night
                will be at an end. But<lb/>God's eyes can look through the thickest<lb/>darkness,
                and he is always looking at you,<lb/>even at this moment.&rdquo;</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(3) align(justify)">Thus they lived together very plea&ndash;<lb
                    type="inWord"/>santly, until Paul was six years old. At<lb/>that time the mother
                complained one<lb/>morning that she was so sick, that she could<lb/>not stand up ;
                she had to stay in bed the<lb/>whole day, and was seized with a fever.<lb/>The next
                day it was worse, so that she<lb/>lost her mind, and became delirious. Good<lb/>old
                Martha tended both mother and child<lb/>faithfully ; but when another day

                stay in this room,<lb/>he must be taken away immediately.&rdquo;<lb/>Finding they
                had no friends, and that<lb/>little Paul was blind, the good doctor took<lb/>him out
                of his little bed, and carried him<lb/>to the window. After he had looked <pb n="6"/>

                bright smile<lb/>passed over his face. Without saying a<lb/>word, he took the child
                across the street<lb/>to a large, fine house. In this house<lb/>lived some rich
                people, friends of the doc&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>tor's, who readily agreed to
                take care of<lb/>the child till the mother got better. Emma,<lb/>the daughter,
                undertook the charge of<lb/>him, and the kind&ndash;hearted doctor came<lb/>every
                day to see him. After a good many<lb/>days, as Paul was asking for his
                mother,<lb/>the doctor promised he should go to her<lb/>very soon, if he would
                promise to be quite<lb/>still while he examined his eyes, for they<lb/>too must be
                cured.</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(3) align(justify)">The boy promised, and kept his word.<lb/>The
                doctor took a sharp instrument, and<lb/>removed a thick skin that had
                hindered<lb/>him from looking upon the bright sky, and<lb/>restored to him the use
                of his eyes. Not<lb/>a cry of pain escaped from Paul's lips as<lb/>the sharp
                instrument cut into his eye.<lb/>The operation succeeded.</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(3) align(justify)">The next day the doctor removed the<lb/>bandage
                he had tied over his eyes. Little<lb/>Paul trembled as the first rays of light <pb n="7"/>

                then<lb/>exclaimed: &ldquo; Now I'm in heaven, and the<lb/>night is past !&rdquo;
                And as he saw the sun&mdash;<lb/>though almost covered with silvery
                clouds<lb/>&mdash;he cried out : &ldquo; There is God's eye !&rdquo;<lb/>He looked
                around him, and at the bloom&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>ing Emma, and asked if she was
                &ldquo; God's<lb/>angel !&quot; But now the eyes had to be<lb/>bandaged up
                again.</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(3) align(justify)">The mother's illness was conquered by<lb/>the
                skill and care of the worthy doctor ;<lb/>but the weakened woman recovered
                very<lb/>slowly.</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(3) align(justify)">It was a beautiful spring morning, and<lb/>the
                mother, for the first time, was walking<lb/>feebly across the room, when Emma
                led<lb/>the boy, dressed in a neat new suit of<lb/>clothes, to the house in which
                his mother<lb/>lived. She opened the door very softly,<lb/>and pushed him gently
                into the room.<lb/>The mother stood near the window, pray&ndash;<lb type="inWord"
                />ing ; and little Paul stood timidly near it ;<lb/>everything was strange to him ;
                he did not<lb/>even know his mother. But Munter<lb/>sprang towards him, and barked
                so loudly<lb/>with delight, that the mother turned<lb/>round, to see the cause.</p>

            <p rend="first-indent(3) align(justify)">&ldquo; My Paul !&rdquo; she cried, as soon as
                she<lb/>saw her child ; and Paul, who knew her<lb/>now by her voice, was in her arms
                and on<lb/>her bosom in a moment. The mother<lb/>hugged and kissed him, and looking
                into<lb/>his face, started back in astonishment, ex&ndash;<lb type="inWord"
                />claiming, &ldquo; Great God ! he sees !&quot;</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(3) align(justify)">&ldquo; Yes, I'm in heaven now,&quot;
                answered<lb/>Paul, with delight. &ldquo; I have seen God's<lb/>eye, and one of His
                angels, and now the<lb/>night is past.&rdquo;</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(3) align(justify)">Overcome with gratitude, the poor<lb/>woman
                sank upon her knees and lifted up<lb/>her hands ; and Paul folded his
                little<lb/>hands, too, and raised them to heaven, as<lb/>his mother had taught him
                long to do ;<lb/>and a wordless prayer went up from the<lb/>hearts of both to the
                throne of the Highest.<lb/>Then came into the mother's mind those<lb/>parting words
                of her dying husband :<lb/>&ldquo; Trust in God ! God never forsakes His<lb/>people
                !&rdquo;</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(3) align(justify)">Tears flowed from her eyes, and
                relieved<lb/>her heart ; and when little Paul saw her<lb/>weeping, he, too, shed the
                first tears that<lb/>I had ever fallen from his eyes ; but they<lb/>were tears of
                joy.</p>
