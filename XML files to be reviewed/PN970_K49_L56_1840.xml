            <p rend="align(justify)"><c rend="lettrine">R</c>ICHARD TURPIN was born in Essex, where
                his father kept<lb/>the Bell Inn, and, after having been the usual time at
                school,<lb/>he was bound apprentice to a butcher, in Whitechapel; but he did<lb/>not
                serve out his time, his master discharging him from his house,<lb/>for his
                brutality, and the impropriety of his conduct generally.<lb/>Turpin was not a little
                encouraged by his parents, who improperly<lb/>indulged him and supplied him with
                money, whereby be was enabled<lb/>to cut a figure in the town, among the blades of
                the &ldquo;road&rdquo; and<lb/>&ldquo;turf,&rdquo; whose company he affected to
                keep.</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">Very early in life he was taken up for poaching
                on the grounds<lb/>of Sir Litton Weston. The principal evidence against him
                was<lb/>Black Dennis, the gamekeeper. He was tried, and the case not<lb/>having been
                proved very clearly against him, he was remanded for<lb/>further examination.</p>

            <fw type="header" rend="align(centre)">THE LIFE OF</fw><lb/>
            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">The ponderous prison lock was turned upon him,
                and the vision<lb/>of his early days recurred to his memory, which presented a
                painful<lb/>distinctness and reality to his mind's eye.</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">He paced round his narrow cell; the image of
                Dennis recurred<lb/>to him ; he seized him, and, in imagination, tore him with the
                    fero&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>city of a caged tiger&mdash;he stamped him to the
                earth, and struggled<lb/>till the cold drops of perspiration started from every
                pore.</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">The possibility of an escape presented itself
                to his view, and in<lb/>less than an hour he succeeded in effecting it. Skirting the
                shady<lb/>side of the hedges, and occasionally making his way along a dry<lb/>ditch,
                at the expense of a few scratches from the brambles, he took<lb/>the direction of
                his foster&ndash;mother's house. He went to the back<lb/>part of it. Selecting a few
                small pebbles, he threw them cautiously<lb/>against the glass. After repeating this
                several times he ventured<lb/>upon trusting his voice in a low whisper. &ldquo;
                Hist, dear mother, it<lb/>is I&mdash;your son Richard,&rdquo; said he. No reply,
                however, came from<lb/>the direction in which his voice was directed ; but at length
                his ear<lb/>caught the sound of the fastenings of the back&ndash;door being
                cautiously<lb/>removed.</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">&ldquo; Come in, for God's sake ! &rdquo; said
                a female voice&mdash;(it was that of<lb/>a girl, who acted in the capacity of a
                servant)&mdash;&ldquo; all the people said<lb/>you were committed to prison
                &rdquo;</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">They entered the house, Turpin knew too well
                the value of every<lb/>moment, and the danger of his situation, to risk his liberty
                by<lb/>remaining long ; he, therefore, after making up a small bundle
                of<lb/>immediate necessaries, and leaving a promise that his mother should<lb/>soon
                hear from him, bade farewell to his home, and again took to the<lb/>fields.</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">Though well aware of his liability to
                apprehension, he could not<lb/>quit Hempstead without one farewell of the scene of
                his joys&mdash;<lb/>the garden of Esther Bevis. Thither he cautiously directed
                his<lb/>steps. The house of Dennis rose upon his view: he thought of<lb/>revenge.
                While thus lurking in the shadow of the trees he fancied<lb/>he heard the hum of
                men's voices : the sounds approached&mdash;and, as<lb/>he lay close to the trunk of
                a tree, two men neared the spot.<lb/>Turpin's blood boiled, as the voice of Dennis
                met his ear, and he<lb/>caught the following part of the conversation.</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">&ldquo; Why, what a precious hurry you're in.
                You're a bigger fool<lb/>than I took you to be; but I'd advise you not to ride rusty

                have it said I done a pal.<lb/>Hows'ever, when we've got this younker out of the
                way&mdash;an' I think<lb/>I've spun his hemp for him&mdash;you shan'n't fiad me

                that old affair still out agin yer. Here's all I have just now,<lb/>but meet me on
                Monday, at Sam's hovel, in the marsh, and I'll<lb/>make it all right. Good
                bye.&rdquo;</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">So saying, Dennis put some silver into the
                hands of his scoundrel&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>looking accomplice, who stealthily
                moved off among the trees. &ldquo; I<lb/>don't half like that vagabound,&rdquo; said
                he, soliloquising ; &ldquo; but I must<lb/>sweeten him a trifle just now. I guess
                Master Dick is sorry by<lb/>this time as how he has made me his enemy.&rdquo;</p>

            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">Dennis began to examine the priming of his 
                <choice><corr>gun</corr><orig>guu</orig></choice>.
                At this<lb/>moment a rustle among the leaves struck on his ear, and while he<lb/>was
                looking for its cause, the very object of his thoughts rushed to&ndash;<lb
                    type="inWord"/>wards him. The gun was half raised to his shoulder, when,
                with<lb/>one hand, Turpin struck down the weapon, and fixing the other with<lb/>a
                gripe, strong as his hatred, on the throat of Dennis, dashed him<lb/>violently
                against the bole of a tree. His senses reeled, as Richard<lb/>compressed the
                villain's throat; and clutching the barrel of the gun,<lb/>the trigger caught some
                part of his dress, exploded, and lodged the<lb/>charge in the body of Dennis. The
                man leaped from the ground<lb/>with a piercing shriek, and fell heavily at the feet
                of Turpin, while

                the blood from his side changed the green turf into a dull red. He<lb/>cast the gun
                from him, and feeling that he was a murderer, fled<lb/>with speed, which he
                slackened not until he had placed some miles<lb/>between himself and his murdered
                victim.</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">He now resolved to make his way into London for
                a while, and<lb/>then betake himself to some foreign land.</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">Soon after this his friends tried to persuade
                him to marry, hoping<lb/>it would reclaim him ; but it was to no purpose, for he
                joined a<lb/>desperate gang of thieves, with whom he committed several
                daring<lb/>robberies on the highway, and afterwards they turned
                housebreakers.<lb/>One of the most cruel of those transactions was the robbery of
                an<lb/>old woman at Loughton, who, refusing to tell where her money was<lb/>hidden,
                was put by Turpin upon the fire, where she was held till she<lb/>made a disclosure,
                when they took her off the grate, and robbed her<lb/>of all they could find. They
                next robbed a farmer at Ripple&ndash;side,<lb/>near Barking, and got about
                &pound;700, which amounted to about &pound;80<lb/>a man. They also attacked the
                house of Mr. Mason, the keeper of<lb/>the Epping Forest, where, in revenge for his
                former zeal in detect&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>ing their poaching, they destroyed
                every thing. But Turpin was<lb/>not in this affair. After plundering Mr. Saunders's
                house, and<lb/>committing numerous other crimes, Turpin and his
                companions<lb/>resolved to appear, in future, on horseback. They accordingly
                hired<lb/>horses at the Old Leaping Bar, in High Holborn, and went to<lb/>Stenmore,
                where they robbed the house of Mr. Lawrence, using<lb/>great brutality, but got
                little plunder. These actions alarmed the<lb/>country, and a reward of &pound;50 was
                offered to any of them who would<lb/>impeach his accomplices. Shortly afterwards
                several of the gang<lb/>were taken and hanged ; and Turpin, being left to himself,
                hastened <lb/>to Cambridge, as the safest place, where he turned
                highwayman.<lb/>Near Alton he met with a comical adventure, which gained him<lb/>a
                very merry companion&mdash;Tom King, the highwayman, who was<lb/>returning from this
                place to London. Turpin seeing him to be well<lb/>drest and mounted, and to have
                the appearance of a gentleman, rode <lb/>up to him, and presenting his pistols, bade
                him stand and deliver,<lb/>when King, laughing, said, &ldquo; What! dog rob dog ?
                Come, come,<lb/>brother Turpin, if you don't know me I know you, and shall be
                glad<lb/>of your company.&rdquo; After a mutual communication of
                circumstances,<lb/>they agreed to keep company in future. They proceeded to
                make<lb/>themselves a cave in the earth, on the Waltham side of Epping,<lb/>near the
                sign of the King's Oak. Through several holes they could<lb/>discover the passengers
                in the road, and would issue forth and rob<lb/>them. Upon one occasion Turpin and
                King stopped a person of<lb/>very decent appearance, near Hackney, and demanded his
                money;<lb/>but the gentleman, bursting into tears, said he was in great
                distress,<lb/>and possessed only eighteen&ndash;pence, upon which, instead of
                robbing<lb/>him, they made him a present of a half&ndash;a&ndash;crown.</p>

                were<lb/>induced to attempt his capture: among the rest was the
                ranger,<lb/>Thomson's man, who, in company with a higgler, whom he
                heard<lb/>advancing, sought to discover the spot of Turpin's retirement.<lb/>Having
                reached the thicket in which the cave was concealed, Thom&ndash;<lb type="inWord"

                that<lb/>thicket. &ldquo; No,&rdquo; said the fellow, &ldquo; but I've got a
                Turpin!&rdquo; and,<lb/>presenting his gun, commanded him to surrender. Turpin
                stood<lb/>talking with him, and, receding to the cave, laid hold of his
                carbine<lb/>and shot him dead, at which the higgler made off. Affairs wore
                a<lb/>very serious aspect for a short time; Turpin was obliged to be
                very<lb/>cautious in his approaches to the metropolis. Turpin and King
                next<lb/>joined one Potter, a desperate roadsman, and performed many rob&ndash;<lb
                    type="inWord"/>beries ; Turpin being sometimes disguised in a miller's frock,
                and<lb/>at others drest like a waggoner. Thus disguised he rode a good
                horse<lb/>towards London, and, when near the Green Man, met one Mr.
                Major,<lb/>(owner of White Stockings, the race&ndash;horse) whom he robbed,
                and<lb/>took from him his whip. Finding Mr. Major had a better horse<lb/>than his
                own, he made him quickly dismount, and change saddles,

                also, when he rode on to London. On the Monday following Mr.<lb/>Bayes, landlord of
                the Green Man, heard that such horse at Mr.<lb/>Major had lost was left at the Red
                Lion Inn, in Whitechapel.<lb/>Going thither, he found it to be the same, and
                resolved to wait till<lb/>somebody came to fetch it. About eleven o'clock at night
                King's<lb/>brother came for the horse. He was immediately taken into
                custody<lb/>when he told the constable, who was charged with him, that a
                lusty<lb/>man, in a white duffel coat, had sent him for the horse, and that
                he<lb/>was then waiting for it in Red&ndash;Lion&ndash;street. Mr. Bayes
                immediately<lb/>went out, found it was King, and attacked him. King clapped
                a<lb/>pistol to Mr. Baye's breast, but it luckily flashed in the pan.</p>

                King<lb/>severely in two places, who said, &ldquo;Why, Dick, you have killed
                me,<lb/>or nearly so.&rdquo; Turpin, alarmed, rode off as fast as he could ; and
                it<lb/>was then that the thoughts of executing his extraordinary ride to<lb/>York
                first flashed across him ; his bosom throbbed high with rapture,<lb/>and he
                involuntarily exclaimed aloud, as he raised himself in the<lb/>saddle, &ldquo; By
                G&mdash;, I will do it ! &rdquo;</p>

            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">He took one last look at the great Babel that
                lay buried in a<lb/>world of trees beneath him ; and as his quick eye ranged over
                the<lb/>magnificent prospect, lit up by the gorgeous sunset, he could not<lb/>help
                thinking of Tom King's last words. &ldquo; Poor fellow ! &rdquo; thought<lb/>Dick,
                he said, truly, &ldquo; he should never see another sunset.&rdquo; Aroused<lb/>by
                the approaching clatter of his pursuers, who were but little behind<lb/>him, Dick
                struck into a lane which lies on the right of the road now<lb/>called
                Shoot&ndash;up&ndash;hill&ndash;lane, and set off at a good pace, in the
                direction<lb/>of Hempstead.</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">His pursuers were now within a hundred yards,
                and shouted to<lb/>him to stand. Pointing to a gate which seemed to bar their
                farther<lb/>progress. Dick, unhesitatingly, charged it, clearing it in
                beautiful<lb/>style. Not so with Coate's party; and the time they lost in
                    un&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>fastening the gate, which none of them liked to
                leap, enabled Dick<lb/>to put additional space between himself and them.</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">The whole neighbourhood was alarmed by the
                cries, and by the<lb/>tramp of horses. The men of Hornsey rushed into the road to
                seize<lb/>the fugitive; and suddenly three horsemen appear in the road ;
                they<lb/>hear the uproar and din. &ldquo; A highwayman&mdash;a highwayman ! &rdquo;
                cry<lb/>the voices, &ldquo;stop him&mdash;stop him !&rdquo; but it was no such easy
                matter.<lb/>With a pistol in each hand, and his bridle in his teeth, did
                Turpin<lb/>boldly pass on. The horsemen gave way, and only to swell the list<lb/>of
                the pursuers.</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">&ldquo;We have him now&mdash;we have him now !
                &rdquo; cried Paterson exult&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>ingly. &ldquo;Shout for your
                lives&mdash;the turnpike&ndash;man will hear us&mdash;<lb/>shout again, again
                :&mdash;the fellow has heard it&mdash;the gate is shut; we<lb/>have him&mdash;ha, ha
                !&rdquo;</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">The old Hornsey toll&ndash;bar was a high gate,
                with cheveux de frize<lb/>in the upper rail. The gate was swung in its lock, and the
                    turnpike&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>man ensconced within his doorway, ready to
                spring upon the run&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>away; but Dick kept steadily on. He
                looked to the right and to<lb/>the left; nothing better offered ; he spoke a few
                words of encourage&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>ment to Bess, gently patted her neck,
                then struck spurs into her<lb/>sides, and cleared the spikes by an inch. Out rushed
                the amazed<lb/>turnpike&ndash;man, thus unmercifully bilked, and was nearly
                trampled<lb/>to death under the feet of Paterson's horse.</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">The pursuers lost considerable time by waiting
                for the turnpike&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>man to open the gate.</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">A few more miles hard riding tired the
                volunteers, and before the<lb/>chase reached Edmonton, most of them were &ldquo; no
                where.&rdquo;&mdash;Unlike<lb/>the men of Tottenham, the people received him with
                acclamations,<lb/>thinking, no doubt, that, &ldquo;like the citizen of famous London
                town,&rdquo;<lb/>he rode for a wager. Presently, however, borne on the wings
                of<lb/>the blast, came the cries of &ldquo;Turpin, Dick Turpin!&rdquo; and
                the<lb/>hurrahs were changed to hootings; but such was the rate at which<lb/>our
                highwayman rode, that no serious opposition could be offered to

                in the middle of the road ; but Turpin treated him as he<lb/>had done the dub at the
                knapping&ndash;jigger, and cleared the driver<lb/>and his little wain with ease. He
                finally reached York, without<lb/>being overtaken by his pursuers.</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">For the last two years of his life Turpin seems
                to have confined<lb/>his residence mostly to the county of York, where, taking the
                name<lb/>of Palmer, he appears to have been so little known, that his
                company<lb/>was chiefly with the best yeomen of the county. At length
                    suspi&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>cion was somehow raised that he was the outlaw
                Turpin ; and two<lb/>persons coming from Lincolnshire, to claim a mare and a foal,
                and a<lb/>horse, which he had stolen in that county, he was committed to<lb/>York
                Castle. He had two trials, upon both of which he was con&ndash;<lb type="inWord"
                />victed on the most conclusive evidence.</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">The unfortunate prisoner, who received no
                assistance to secure<lb/>him from the inclemency of the law, was hanged, as
                previously<lb/>sentenced, on the 7th of April, 1739.</p>

                    <l>With its jet undisfigured with one lock of white ;</l>
                    <l>The throat branched with veins, prompt to charge or caress,</l>

                    <l>I laughed at his threats and his vows of redress,</l>
                    <l>I was sure of an <hi rend="italic">alibi</hi> then with Black Bess.</l>
