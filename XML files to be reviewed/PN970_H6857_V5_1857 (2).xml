                invite<lb/>Robert and Joseph, the two little<lb/>sons of Mr. Seward, to spend a
                day<lb/>at Westfield, where the old gentle&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>man lived with
                his good wife in a<lb/>very neat and beautiful house.</p>
            <p rend="align(justify) indent(2)"> There was a stage&ndash;coach which <lb/>

                returned again at nine at<lb/>night. This coach travelled in<lb/>an hour between Mr.
                Seward's<lb/>and Westfield; and the time<lb/>of its going and coming
                served<lb/>quite as well as if it had been<lb/>set up only to carry Robert<lb/>and

                but, when you go a&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>broad, you must learn to pick

                Joseph<lb/>were on the top of the coach,<lb/>travelling as fast as four
                horses<lb/>could carry them. There was no<lb/>room for them in the front,
                so<lb/>they sat at the back; and there<lb/>were three men and one woman<lb/>with
                them: and these people <lb/>

                <lb/> were talking. An old man, and<lb/>a young one who sat opposite<lb/>to him,
                both seemed very vulgar<lb/>people; I do not mean poor<lb/>people, nor people in low
                rank,<lb/>but people who talked vulgarly,<lb/>and used bad words. They
                were<lb/>cruel people, also, and talked of<lb/>fighting&ndash;cocks, and such sort
                of<lb/>things: and they said that they<lb/>were going to see a badger bait&ndash;<lb
                    type="inWord"/>ed that morning at Westfield,<lb/>in a pool which Joseph knew
                to<lb/>be not very far from his grand&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>father's house; for I
                am sorry<lb/>to say, that Joseph listened<lb/>with all his ears to these men,<lb/>
                <lb/>quite forgetting the promise he<lb/>had just made to his papa. But <lb/>

                <lb/> Robert did not attend to these<lb/>people, for the first words he<lb/>heard
                from them being bad, he<lb/>turned away from them as much<lb/>as he could, towards
                the woman,<lb/>who was telling the old man a<lb/>very useful thing. It was
                this.<lb/>She had slept the night before at<lb/>an inn; and was supping in
                a<lb/>kitchen where a little child pulled<lb/>down on its arm a dish of
                    scald&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>ing tea; and, while the child was<lb/>screaming
                with pain, some one pre&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>sent took the dredger from the
                wall<lb/>where it was hanging, and well<lb/>floured the baby's arm:
                &ldquo;And<lb/>do you know, Sir,&rdquo; said the wo&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>man at
                the top of the coach,<lb/>&ldquo; that the baby ceased to cry in <lb/>

                <lb/> a few moments; and the person<lb/>told its mother, that if she would<lb/>leave
                the flour there till it fell off<lb/>of itself when the arm was well,<lb/>she would
                have no more trouble<lb/>with it. Now, Sir,&quot; said the wo&ndash;<lb
                    type="inWord"/>man, &ldquo; I call that a very useful<lb/>piece of knowledge,
                and one that<lb/>it was worth taking a journey to<lb/>learn.&rdquo;</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">&ldquo;And so it is, Madam,&rdquo; re&ndash;<lb

            <p rend="align(justify)">Now Robert and Joseph had<lb/>only six miles to go, so they

                <lb/> and there were so many things<lb/>to see. In the first place, there<lb/>was a
