                    of Thumb<lb/>Hall, in Northumberland. He was<lb/>born in the very year in which
                    Sir<lb/>Walter Raleigh lost his life for serv&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>ing his

                <p rend="first-indent(2)">At the time of his birth the sun was<lb/>eclipsed; which
                    'tis supposed, stinted<lb/>his growth, and made him almost in&ndash;<lb

                    learned gentleman<lb/>looked at him through a great pair of<lb/>spectacles, and
                    told the parents, that<lb/>he would be a very little man, and a<lb/>very great
                    man; which is a paradox or<lb/>riddle, we are to resolve
                    by&ndash;and&ndash;by.</p>
                <p rend="first-indent(2)">When his father heard this, he took<lb/>him upon his
                    little finger, and chirped<lb/>to him, as a boy does to a bird: and<lb/>his
                    mother wrapped him up in a piece<lb/>of cotton, put him into a thimble

                    may be made by other<lb/>means; but a great man cannot be<lb/>formed without

                    where the egg lay<lb/>was abundantly too heavy for the<lb/>other, and almost
                    weighed him down.<lb/>Tired and fatigued, however, he at<lb/>last came to a

                    shelter, and took up his<lb/>lodging for that night.</p>
                <p rend="first-indent(2)">The young squirrels liked his com&ndash;<lb type="inWord"

                    <fw type="pagenumber" rend="align(centre)">14</fw><lb/> deal; but when he saw
                    Tom pull the<lb/>egg out of his pocket, and found that<lb/>he did not intend to
                    feast on their<lb/>food, he became easy, and they all sat<lb/>down and supped
                    together.</p>
                <p rend="first-indent(2)">In the morning Tom arose with<lb/>the sun, as every good

                    journey,<lb/>travelling still on the rough bark till<lb/>almost night: when, as
                    it rained very<lb/>hard, he crept for shelter into a wren's<lb/>nest. The poor
                    wren was very much<lb/>alarmed on seeing so formidable a<lb/>fellow enter her
                    dwelling, which was<lb/>then full of young ones; and as Tom<lb/>had too much

                    was attacked<lb/>by an humble bee, with whom he<lb/>fought a most desperate
                    battle. What<lb/>the drone took him for, it is hard to<lb/>say, but he perched
                    on a shrub by the<lb/>root of the tree, raised his gristly<lb/>beard, and
                    attacked our hero full in<lb/>the face. Tom received the blow<lb/>with that
                    undauntedness which true<lb/>courage can only inspire, and drawing<lb/>his
                    sword, returned the blow with the<lb/>most intrepid resolution. Those,

                    and tell how<lb/>the thunder of their arms re&ndash;echoed<lb/>from the distant

                    however, one of the<lb/>hounds which Tom knew, making up<lb/>to him, he laid

                <p rend="first-indent(2)">In compiling the history of Tom<lb/>Thumb, we forgot to
                    mention one<lb/>circumstance, which gave the Giant<lb/>king and all his court a
                    great inclina&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>tion to become acquainted with
                    letters<lb/>and modern learning.</p>
                <p rend="first-indent(2)">There was at this time in the cuc&ndash;<lb type="inWord"
                    />koo court, a natural philosopher, who<lb/>never knew the use of letters, yet
                    was<lb/>wise and ingenious; him Mr. Thumb<lb/>taught to read and write, in order
                    that<lb/>he might correspond with him when<lb/>he travelled; and, on a certain
                    time,<lb/>when he had occasion to visit the ex&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>treme
                    parts of his father's kingdoms,<lb/>with his wife the princess, who was<lb/>then
                    big with child, he took some<lb/>pigeons with him, which had been<lb/>bred by
                    this philosopher, in order to<lb/>convey the most speedy intelligence<lb/>to his
                    father's court of what might <lb/>happen to them on the journey. Now <pb n="28"/>
                    <fw type="pagenumber" rend="align(centre)">28</fw><lb/> it came to pass, that
                    when they were<lb/>ninety&ndash;five thousand miles from home,<lb/>his princess
                    was brought to bed of two<lb/>bouncing boys, nine hundred times<lb/>as big as
                    himself; upon which he de&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>spatched a pigeon with a note
                    tied<lb/>round her leg, directed to his friend<lb/>the philosopher, to inform
                    his father<lb/>of that important affair. Domine<lb/>Doodle, for that was the
                    philosopher's<lb/>name, carried it immediately to the<lb/>king, and told him
                    that his daughter<lb/>was brought to bed of Gog and Ma&ndash;<lb type="inWord"
                    />gog, two great princes. Where are<lb/>they? said the Giant, greatly
                    rejoiced<lb/>at the event. Ninety&ndash;five thousand<lb/>miles off, answered
                    the philosopher.</p>
                <p rend="first-indent(2)">And how came you by the news?<lb/>said his majesty. From
                    that great<lb/>prince Tom Thumb himself, replied<lb/>the other, and threw the
                    letter on the<lb/>table.</p>

                <p rend="first-indent(2)">The king was greatly astonished,<lb/>and taking up the

                    the glass out of the<lb/>windows. However, he despatched<lb/>nineteen fleet
                    horsemen, ten chariots,<lb/>twenty trumpeters, and a kettle<lb/>drummer to
                    enquire into the affair;<lb/>and finding it true, and seeing the<lb/>princess
                    enter the palace soon after<lb/>with Gog in one arm and Magog in<lb/>the other,

                    finder, he <lb/>asked him how it was possible to talk<lb/>to his friends, and
