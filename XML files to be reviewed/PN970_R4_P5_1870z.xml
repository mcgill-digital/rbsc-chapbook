                out of school, were<lb/>sure to stop and look at the<lb/>red&ndash;cheeked fruit in
                the cherry<lb/>season. But it is a sad thing to<lb/>tell, that there were some of
                the<lb/>school&ndash;boys who not only threw<lb/>stones to knock down the
                    cher&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>ries, but took a delight in playing<lb/>some other
                foolish tricks, which<lb/>often ended to their own hurt<lb/>and shame.</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">By the side of the cherry&ndash;<lb/>tree at
                Widow White's was a<lb/>large water&ndash;butt, placed near the<lb/>gate which
                opened into a green,<lb/>shady lane; and to this spot<lb/>some of the bad boys
                would<lb/>often slily creep, and then<lb/>turn the tap, that the water<lb/>might run
                to waste, while they<lb/>got quickly away. This conduct <pb n="5"/>

                <fw type="pagenumber" rend="align(right)">3</fw><lb/> was the more shameful, as
                water<lb/>was scarce in the village, and peo&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>ple had to
                bring it from a distant<lb/>brook.</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">Many a time did the poor<lb/>widow try to
                overtake the wicked<lb/>boys, but they were too swift of<lb/>foot for her to secure.
                One day,<lb/>however, just after the school<lb/>had broken up, three of the
                boys<lb/>made their way to the garden&ndash;<lb/>gate. They looked up and
                down<lb/>the lane, and over the common.<lb/>They saw no one at hand, so
                they<lb/>slily opened the gate, and set<lb/>the water running all over the<lb/>path.
                They were about to<lb/>hasten away, when who should<lb/>turn the corner but
                Widow<lb/>White; and little John Turner,<lb/>in his flurry, ran directly against <pb

                caught in her<lb/>arms.</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">John tried hard to get away,<lb/>but holding
                him fast by the<lb/>collar of his jacket, she managed<lb/>to take him through her
                kitchen,<lb/>into her little front parlour.<lb/>&ldquo; There now, sit down,&rdquo;
                said<lb/>Mrs. White, almost out of<lb/>breath : &ldquo; sit there, I desire
                you,<lb/>till I return.&rdquo; She then went<lb/>out of the room, taking care
                to<lb/>lock the door after her. John<lb/>sat down, and was now left to<lb/>his own
                thoughts, which were<lb/>not of a very pleasant kind.</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">&ldquo; How foolish have I been to<lb/>get into
                such trouble!&rdquo; said John.<lb/>&ldquo; What will my mother say to<lb/>me, and

            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">While John was thus speak&ndash;<lb
                    type="inWord"/>ing to himself, he heard the<lb/>steps of Widow White at
                the<lb/>door. As the lock was unturned,<lb/>his eyes at once fell on the<lb/>hands
                of the old lady, for he<lb/>made sure she had gone into<lb/>the garden for a stick
                to beat<lb/>him. But what was his surprise<lb/>when he saw in her hand a
                plate<lb/>of ripe cherries!</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">&ldquo; Do you like cherries, my<lb/>little boy
                ?&rdquo; she said, in her<lb/>usual kind manner. John looked<lb/>at her, and did not
                know what<lb/>to answer.&ldquo; Does she mean,&rdquo;<lb/>thought he, &ldquo; to
                give me the<lb/>cherries first, and the flogging <pb n="8"/>

                ?&rdquo; &ldquo; Come, do not<lb/>be afraid: see, if you think they<lb/>are
                ripe,&rdquo; she continued. John<lb/>now took one. &ldquo; There, don't<lb/>be
                afraid, take a few more.&rdquo;<lb/>Widow White then placed the<lb/>whole plateful
                on the table, and<lb/>invited him to take as many as<lb/>he thought would do him
                good.</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">The boy could not make out<lb/>what it all
                meant. But as he<lb/>saw she did not look angry, he<lb/>took courage, and ate nearly
                all<lb/>the fruit. &ldquo;Well, John,&rdquo; said<lb/>she, &ldquo; are they not fine
                cherries ?&rdquo;<lb/>In a short time he began to<lb/>think that Widow White
                was,<lb/>indeed, a good old woman; and<lb/>the more so, when she sat down<lb/>by his
                side, and talked to him<lb/>kindly of the folly and sin of<lb/>playing hurtful
                tricks, and of <pb n="9"/>

                a<lb/>new heart, that he might be made<lb/>sorry for his sins, and find
                mercy<lb/>for the sake of Jesus Christ the<lb/>only and ever&ndash;blessed
                Saviour.</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">After she had thus spoken to<lb/>him, she said,
                &ldquo; There, John,<lb/>you may now go home, or your<lb/>mother will think some
                harm has<lb/>come to you; but before you go<lb/>I wish you to tell me if you
                will<lb/>turn the tap any more, and<lb/>waste the water from the butt
                ?&rdquo;<lb/>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; cried John, as the<lb/>tears came into his eyes,
                and<lb/>his heart beat quickly, &ldquo;that I<lb/>never will; and if I see
                any<lb/>other boys about to do it, I will<lb/>try all I can to stop them.&rdquo;</p>
