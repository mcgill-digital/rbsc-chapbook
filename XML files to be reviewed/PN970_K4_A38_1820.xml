                    was<lb/>ever seen. She had by her former<lb/>husband two daughters, but of
                    her<lb/>own humour, who were indeed exactly<lb/>like her in all things. He had
                        like&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>wise by another wife a daughter
                    of<lb/>unparalleled goodness and sweetness<lb/>of temper, which she took from
                    her<lb/>mother, who was one of the best crea&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>tures in

                    the mother&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>in&ndash;law began to show herself in
                    her<lb/>colours. She could not bear the good<lb/>qualities of this pretty girl,
                    and the<lb/>less, because she made her daughters<lb/>appear more odious. She
                    employed<lb/>her in the meanest work of the house,<lb/>she scoured the dishes,
                    tables, &amp;c.<lb/>and rubbed madam's chamber, and<lb/>those of the misses her
                    daughters; she<lb/>lay up in a very dirty garret upon a<lb/>wretched straw bed,
                    while her sisters<lb/>lay in fine rooms, with floors all inlaid,<lb/>upon beds
                    of the very newest fashion.<lb/>Her books were the only companions<lb/>she had,
                    and when her sisters went<lb/>out, she used to take the opportunity<lb/>of
                    reading their's.</p>
                <p rend="first-indent(2)">The poor girl bore all patiently,<lb/>and dared not to

                    <fw type="pagenumber" rend="align(centre)">7</fw><lb/> would have rattled her
                    off; for his<lb/>wife governed him entirely. When<lb/>she had done her work, she
                    used to<lb/>go into the chimney corner, and sit<lb/>down among the cinders and
                    ashes,<lb/>which made her commonly be called<lb/>CINDER BREECH ; but the
                    youngest,<lb/>who was not so rude and uncivil as<lb/>the eldest, called her
                    CINDERILLA,<lb/>however Cinderilla, notwithstanding<lb/>her mean apparel, was an
                    hundred<lb/>times handsomer than either of her sis&ndash;<lb type="inWord"
                    />ters, though they were always dressed<lb/>very richly.</p>
                <p rend="first-indent(2)">It happened that the King's son<lb/>gave a ball, and
                    invited all persons of<lb/>fashion to it; our young misses were<lb/>invited; for
                    they cut a very grand<lb/>figure among the quality. They were<lb/>mightily
                    delighted at this invitation,<lb/>and wonderfully busy in choosing out <pb n="8"/>
                    <fw type="pagenumber" rend="align(centre)">8</fw><lb/> such gowns, petticoats,
                    and caps, as<lb/>might become them. This was a new<lb/>trouble to Cinderilla;
                    for it was she<lb/>who ironed her sisters' linen, and clear<lb/>starched their
                    ruffles: they talked all<lb/>day long of nothing but how they<lb/>should be
                    dressed, and were continually<lb/>viewing themselves in their glasses.</p>

                    <fw type="pagenumber" rend="align(centre)">9</fw><lb/> trimmings. And I, said
                    the youngest,<lb/>shall only have my usual petticoat;<lb/>but then, to make
                    amends for that, I<lb/>will put on my gold flowered manteau,<lb/>and my diamond
                    stomacher, which is<lb/>far from being the most ordinary one<lb/>in the world.
                    They sent for the best<lb/>hair&ndash;dresser they could get, to make<lb/>up
                    their head&ndash;dresses, and adjust their<lb/>pinners, and had their red
                    brushes<lb/>and patches from Madamoiselle de la<lb/>Blond.</p>
                <p rend="first-indent(2)">Cinderilla was likewise called up<lb/>to be consulted in

                    to dress their heads,<lb/>which they were very willing she<lb/>should do. As she
                    was doing this,<lb/>they said to her, Cinderilla, would you<lb/>not be glad to
                    go to the ball? Ah! <pb n="10"/>
                    <fw type="pagenumber" rend="align(centre)">10</fw><lb/> said she, you only jeer
                    me, it is not<lb/>for such as me to go to balls; thou<lb/>art in the right of
                    it, replied they: it<lb/>would make the people laugh to see
                    a<lb/>Cinder&ndash;breech at a ball. Any one but<lb/>Cinderilla would have
                    dressed their<lb/>heads awry ; but she was very good,<lb/>and dressed them
                    perfectly well. They<lb/>were almost two days without eating,<lb/>so much were
                    they transported with<lb/>joy, they broke a dozen laces in try&ndash;<lb

                    slender shape.</p>
                <p rend="first-indent(2)">At last the happy day came, they<lb/>went to court, and
                    Cinderilla followed<lb/>them with her eyes as long as she<lb/>could, and when
                    she had lost sight of<lb/>them, fell a crying.</p>
                <p rend="first-indent(2)">Her god&ndash;mother, who saw her all<lb/>in tears, asked
                    her what was the mat&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>ter? I wish I could&mdash;I wish I
