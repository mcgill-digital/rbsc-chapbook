                was at the time reclining upon her<lb/>mother's lap, while the younger, was
                on<lb/>the couch at her side with her head fond&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>ly resting
                upon her shoulder. The two<lb/>were as opposite in looks as in temper.<lb/>Anna was
                about eight years old, and<lb/>Clara three years younger. Anna was<lb/>very pretty.
                Her light brown hair fell<lb/>in graceful curls over her white neck;<lb/>she had
                bright blue eyes, her cheeks were<lb/>like roses, and when she was a good
                girl,<lb/>she was extremely lovely. Everybody<lb/>admired, when they <hi

                soon<lb/>made them withdraw their admiration<lb/>&mdash; for no one is worthy of
                esteem, who<lb/>has nothing but beauty of person, with&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>out
                that of mind, to recommend them.<lb/>Clara seldom attracted attention at
                first,<lb/>for she was by no means beautiful. Her<lb/>complexion was pale, her eyes

                was always<lb/>ready to oblige, and would leave her<lb/>play to render any person a
                benefit, and<lb/>if smaller girls than herself came to visit<lb/>her, she gave them
                her dolls and toys,<lb/>and would try in every way to amuse<lb/>and please them. But
                Anna never did<lb/>so; she was too lazy to do a favor for<lb/>those around her, and
                too selfish to care<lb/>for the pleasure or convenience of any<lb/>one but herself.
                It distressed her mother<lb/>very much to see so beautiful a girl of<lb/>such a
                disposition, and she could not<lb/>avoid loving little Clara more every day<lb/>for
                her goodness and obedience. After<lb/>the last scene, the party sat silent for
                a<lb/>few minutes, but Anna was too obstinate<lb/>to think of feeling sorry for her
                conduct,<lb/>though reproved by her mother's words,<lb/>for her sister's different

                them ? Remember<lb/>that you will hereafter have to give an<lb/>account of your
                conduct to them &mdash; and<lb/>that of every unkindness God takes no&ndash;<lb

                not wish to leave<lb/>your netting for an instant, nor your warm<lb/>fire, and yet
                you did not mind disturbing<lb/>the servants when you know how fatigued<lb/>they are
                all day, and that at night they<lb/>strive to do a little work for
                themselves,<lb/>such as platting straw for baskets and<lb/>mats, by the sale of
                which they earn<lb/>money, to purchase a few luxuries for<lb/>their families.
                Believe me, my child,<lb/>if we do not think of the comforts of<lb/>others, we shall
                be neither respected nor<lb/>valued ourselves, and shall find few<lb/>friends.

                rap at the door<lb/>made her forget the advice in curiosity<lb/>to know who was at
                it. She hastily<lb/>jumped up, and ran into the entry (in<lb/>spite of the cold she
                had refused to en&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>counter a few minutes before) and
                    open&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>ed the door ere James could reach the<lb/>spot.
                The snow blew in her face, and<lb/>enwreathed her soft ringlets, and her<lb/>cheeks
                were crimsoned with the sharp<lb/>air, but Anna regarded not all this, for<lb/>she
                was delighted to see the milliner's<lb/>girl, with a basket containing their

                home to his family before sun&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>down, little dreaming that
                they were so<lb/>near him. But he was soon apprized of<lb/>their presence by the
