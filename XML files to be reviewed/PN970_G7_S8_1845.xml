                <lb/>
                <p rend="align(justify)">ABOUT twenty&ndash;five years ago, a stranger
                    going<lb/>through a street in the outskirts of the large<lb/>and busy town of
                    Birmingham, would have<lb/>heard the noise of hammers in almost every<lb/>house.
                    The whole town is alive with the roar<lb/>of furnaces and the clatter of
                    machinery, but<lb/>in this street, which was very black and dirty,<lb/>it was
                    nothing but thump and smite from<lb/>morning till night, as the nailmakers, or
                        nail&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>ers, as they are called, plied their trade.
                    The<lb/>front door of nearly every house stood open,<lb/>and it was easy to be
                    seen that not much pains<lb/>was taken to keep the interior clean and
                        com&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>fortable; women were seated on the step,
                        gos&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>siping with one another about bad times
                    and<lb/>family affairs, while their children played in<lb/>the muddy gutters
                    that ran down each side of<lb/>the street. Looking through to the low
                        work&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>shop at the back of one of these houses, a
                        lit&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>tle boy might have been seen, standing on
                    an<lb/>old iron pot turned upside down to raise him<lb/>high enough to reach the
                    anvil, helping his<lb/>father to make nails. The rods of iron were<lb/>made red
                    hot in the fire, and then the two,<lb/>father and son, worked away upon their
                    anvils, <pb n="5"/>
                    <fw type="header" rend="align(centre)">THE STORY OF PETER LAWLEY.</fw>
                    <fw type="pagenumber" rend="align(right)">5</fw>
                    <lb/> striking off nails as fast as their hammers<lb/>could go. Peter Lawley,
                    that was the little<lb/>boy's name, did all that he could to help to earn<lb/>a
                    few shillings every week; but he was only<lb/>eight years old, and although from
                    practice<lb/>his arms were pretty strong, yet after hammer&ndash;<lb
                        type="inWord"/>ing for ten or twelve hours a day, he was often<lb/>ready to
                    drop with fatigue. His father was<lb/>not an unkind man, but he was poor,
                    and<lb/>thought it better to make Peter work, than to<lb/>send him to school.
                    Sometimes when nails<lb/>were wanted in a great hurry, the little
                    fellow<lb/>could not get a minute for play. The father<lb/>did not know that he
                    was doing wrong by<lb/>keeping his son at work for so many hours<lb/>shut up in
                    a smoky forge, nor was he aware<lb/>that children, to be healthy and strong,
                    should<lb/>be let to run about, and laugh and shout in<lb/>the open fields and
                    bright sunshine.</p>
                <p rend="align(justify) first-indent(3)">Lawley and his wife had been married
                    about<lb/>twelve years; they had four children, two<lb/>girls, one older and one
                    younger than Peter,<lb/>and a poor little boy under three years of age,<lb/>who
                    was a helpless cripple, owing to a fall<lb/>from his mother's arms when he was
                    quite an<lb/>infant. The girls played about barefooted in<lb/>the street, and
                    paid no attention to what was<lb/>said by their mother, and the little lame
                    boy<lb/>sat fretting at the door or by the side of the<lb/>fire. Peter seemed to
                    be pretty much like his<lb/>companions, except that he was rather
                    more<lb/>willing to stick to work than nailers' boys in<lb/>general, and was
                    very kind to his helpless bro&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>ther, and, did what he
                    could to amuse him.<lb/>In other respects he was as ignorant and dirty <pb n="6"/>

                    <lb/>as any other children in the neighbourhood.<lb/>But Peter used to think: at
                    work, when he<lb/>could get a chance to speak, he was always<lb/>asking
                    questions of his father about things<lb/>that he had seen or heard of. The
                    parent<lb/>answered as far as his knowledge went, but he<lb/>had never learned
                    to read, which prevented<lb/>him from talking to his son of many things<lb/>that
                    would have been useful. Besides he was<lb/>always in a hurry to make as many
                    nails as<lb/>possible, and could not spare time to answer<lb/>Peter's questions;
                    he did not see much good in<lb/>being over curious, he could not earn
                    money<lb/>enough for his family's wants; and to strug&ndash;<lb type="inWord"
                    />gling people life often seems nothing but a<lb/>gloomy and dismal object.</p>
                <p rend="align(justify) first-indent(3)">Peter's father and mother had fallen
                    into<lb/>careless and disorderly habits; the few things<lb/>they had in the
                    house were seldom clean or in<lb/>their right places. If a dish or saucepan
                    were<lb/>wanted, it was always found dirty, and had to<lb/>be cleaned before it
                    could be used. The floor<lb/>was rarely swept, and the fireplace was
                    always<lb/>choked with an unsightly heap of ashes.<lb/>People sometimes think
                    that it is less trou&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>ble to let things take their
                    chance, than to<lb/>spend a little time in setting them to rights.<lb/>But they
                    are under a great mistake: where<lb/>dirt is not removed, and weekly earnings
                    are<lb/>not properly laid out, there must be hardships<lb/>and frequently
                    sickness in the family. The<lb/>elder Lawley was not worse than others of
                    his<lb/>class; he did not know that it was his duty to<lb/>send his children to
                    school, and believed he<lb/>was doing no more than fair when he went <pb n="7"/>
                    <fw type="header" rend="align(centre)">PETER LAWLEY.</fw>
                    <fw type="pagenumber" rend="align(right)">7</fw>
                    <lb/> every evening to the public house to drink,<lb/>and sing songs with other
                    nailers of the neigh&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>bourhood.</p>
                <p rend="align(justify) first-indent(3)">Peter, as we have said, was inclined to
                    be<lb/>thoughtful. Not far from where he lived<lb/>there was a large school, and
                    Peter had often<lb/>peeped in at the door as he passed, wondering<lb/>what so
                    many boys could find to do sitting<lb/>for two or three hours upon long forms,
                    and<lb/>what they wanted with books and slates.<lb/>Among the scholars were two
                    or three boys<lb/>and girls with whom he was acquainted, and<lb/>he could not
                    help noticing that they were<lb/>always cleanly dressed, their hair was
                    combed,<lb/>and hands and faces washed every morning<lb/>before they went to
                    school, and they were not<lb/>rude and quarrelsome in the streets, as
                    many<lb/>are who had not been taught better. One day<lb/>when work was rather
                    slack, Peter got leave<lb/>to go home with these children, and then he<lb/>was
                    astonished to see how clean and tidy the<lb/>house was, so different from his
                    own home.<lb/>Every thing was clean and in its place; the<lb/>floor was swept,
                    the fire&ndash;place was bright, and<lb/>there was no heap of ashes under the
                    grate.<lb/>A few books lay on the mantel&ndash;piece, and the<lb/>eldest boy and
                    girl used to read aloud when<lb/>their father came in from his work, and
                    their<lb/>mother was busy with her sewing. Peter lis&ndash;<lb type="inWord"
                    />tened to the reading with great pleasure, he<lb/>liked to look at the pictures
                    in the books, and<lb/>was never tired of asking questions about<lb/>them. He
                    began to think it would be a very<lb/>nice thing to know how to read, and
                    talk<lb/>about lessons and pictures to his little lame<lb/>brother and his
                    sisters.</p>

                <lb/>

                <p rend="align(justify) first-indent(3)">Not long afterwards, Peter was helping
                    his<lb/>father as usual, when all at once he let his<lb/>hammer rest upon the
                    anvil, and looking up<lb/>into his father's face, said, &lsquo;Father, I
                    should<lb/>like to go to school.&rsquo;</p>
                <p rend="align(justify) first-indent(3)">&lsquo;What do you want to go there
                    for?&rsquo; asked<lb/>the parent in reply.</p>
                <p rend="align(justify) first-indent(3)">&lsquo;Oh, father,&rsquo; answered Peter
                    timidly, &lsquo;Mary<lb/>and Billy Jackson go; and they have got<lb/>books, and
                    they know all about a great many<lb/>things. Do let me go, father.&rsquo;</p>
                <p rend="align(justify) first-indent(3)">&lsquo;What's put that into the boy's
                    head!&rsquo;<lb/>said the elder Lawley; &lsquo;but it's no bad thing<lb/>to be
                    able to read a bit. I'll talk to your<lb/>mother about it.&rsquo; At this Peter
                    plied his<lb/>hammer harder than ever, and went to sleep<lb/>that night
                    bewildered with hopes and fears<lb/>about what his parents would decide.</p>
                <p rend="align(justify) first-indent(3)">When the children were all in bed, Mr.
                    and<lb/>Mrs. Lawley talked the matter over; they<lb/>were both willing that
                    Peter should get a little<lb/>learning, but did not know how to spare
                    him<lb/>from the anvil, where he helped to earn the<lb/>weekly wages, and they
                    could not afford to<lb/>give up any portion of the sum which never<lb/>seemed
                    enough to last from one Saturday to<lb/>another. At last it was settled that the
                    eldest<lb/>girl should help her father at the forge, and<lb/>that the next
                    Monday morning Peter should<lb/>go to school.</p>

                    her husband was out of work,<lb/>had broken her temper and made her
                    careless<lb/>and fretful. Where everything was so dirty<lb/>out of doors, it
                    seemed to be of no use to try<lb/>to keep the indoors clean. The windows
                    at<lb/>one time used to look clear and bright, with a<lb/>clean blind stretched
                    across the inside; and<lb/>the floor was clean swept and the house put
                    to<lb/>rights once or twice every day; but now you<lb/>could not see through the
                    windows for smoke<lb/>and dirt, many of the panes were broken and<lb/>stopped
                    with paper or old rags, giving the out&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>side of the
                    house a most wretched appearance,<lb/>and the inside, as we said before, was
                    left to<lb/>go dirty and untidy from one week's end to<lb/>another. Perhaps if
                    any kind person had<lb/>called on Mrs. Lawley in a friendly way,
                    and<lb/>reminded her of the pleasant days she used to<lb/>have when living at
                    the farm&ndash;house, where all<lb/>was so clean, with a place for every thing,

                    and<lb/>second&ndash;hand shoes, before the end of the week.<lb/>Monday morning
                    came ; Peter was up early,<lb/>and when he saw his sister trying to work

                    />ed that&ndash; he were not going to school; but then<lb/>again the thought
                    came into his mind, that he<lb/>would not be long in learning to read,
                    when<lb/>he might come back and take his old place at<lb/>the anvil. His mother
                    washed his face and<lb/>combed his hair, and could not help thinking<lb/>how
                    much better her litte boy looked with<lb/>clothes and skin clean than ragged and
                    dirty.<lb/>Any one would have thought that Peter was<lb/>going away on a long
                    journey, for his mother<lb/>kissed him, his two sisters ran up and
                    kissed<lb/>him in turn, and then, after saying good&ndash;bye<lb/>to his father
                    and stooping to kiss his little<lb/>lame brother, Peter set off for the

                    found<lb/>himself in the large room among nearly two<lb/>hundred boys, and he
                    hardly knew what to do<lb/>for some minutes, until the master caught
                    sight<lb/>of him, and called him up to the desk. After<lb/>taking down Peter's
                    name, and asking him the<lb/>usual questions about his parents and where<lb/>he
                    lived, he showed him to his place in the <pb n="11"/>

                    their A, B, C, under one of the older boys<lb/>as teacher. Every thing looked
                    strange to<lb/>Peter; he could not well make out what was<lb/>going on, so many
                    voices were saying lessons<lb/>at the same time ; and when he saw what
                    hard<lb/>letters he had to learn, he almost wished him&ndash;<lb type="inWord"
                    />self back again in the forge. Presently, how&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>ever, he
                    heard boys younger than himself go<lb/>through their lessons without any
                    trouble,<lb/>which made him think he should soon be able<lb/>to do as well, and
                    when it came to his turn,<lb/>he said the letters, one after the other, as
                    they<lb/>were called out by the teacher, without making<lb/>any mistakes. When
                    he went home, he had<lb/>many things to talk about, and he tried to re&ndash;<lb
                        type="inWord"/>collect the names of the letters in his lesson,<lb/>and say
                    them over to his little brother who sat<lb/>in his usual place on the floor.
                    This went on<lb/>for some time, and before many weeks Peter<lb/>had got over the
                    first difficulties,, and knew<lb/>the names of all the letters. But this was
                    not<lb/>the best of it; his mother kept up the habit<lb/>of sending him to
                    school, with hands and face<lb/>clean, and his clothes as tidy as possible.
                    A<lb/>good habit in one thing often leads to a good<lb/>habit in another, and
                    after a time the Lawleys'<lb/>house began to look cleaner ; the ashes

                    The<lb/>clothes of the two girls and the little lame<lb/>boy did not look so

                    found out what every one is<lb/>sure to find out if he makes the attempt,
                    that<lb/>things are not half so difficult as we think, if<lb/>we only keep a
                    good heart and make up our<lb/>minds to master them. He was not a
                    slow<lb/>learner, and was soon able to understand most<lb/>things that were said
                    to him. He was also<lb/>careful to make the most of his time, and
                    in&ndash;<lb/>stead of playing about the streets, contrived<lb/>to be one of the
                    first at the school, both morn&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>ing and afternoon. It is
                    not to be supposed<lb/>that Peter became a very good boy all at
                    once,<lb/>sometimes he neglected to keep himself clean,<lb/>or forgot to tell
                    the truth; but he was willing<lb/>to be taught, and by making the most of
                    his<lb/>time got on quite as fast as many boys who<lb/>were older, and could
                    learn quicker, but did<lb/>not think so much of the real use of know&ndash;<lb
                        type="inWord"/>ledge. By the end of a year, Peter was up in<lb/>the same
                    class with Billy Jackson, whose read&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>ing had first set
                    him to think of going to<lb/>school, and he could read and write as well

                    could hardly earn enough<lb/>to buy food and clothing, and pay rent, and<lb/>the
                    boy was much puzzled to know how to get<lb/>a little money for what he wanted.
                    At last a<lb/>thought struck him: he had often felt sorry<lb/>at seeing his
                    sister in the forge, and made up<lb/>his mind to go to work again at
                    nail&ndash;making<lb/>every evening, by which his sister would have<lb/>a few
                    hours' rest, and he would perhaps be<lb/>able to get together a few pence to buy
                    the<lb/>books and slate. His father agreed to let him<lb/>have part of what he
                    could earn in this way,<lb/>and Peter went to work with right good will,<lb/>and
                    made nails faster than ever. In a few<lb/>weeks, he had saved enough to buy a
                    reading<lb/>book, and the first thing he did on going home<lb/>from school was
                    to give his brother a lesson.<lb/>Little David, who could not run about
                    and<lb/>amuse himself as other children, seemed very<lb/>glad to have something
                    to do, and very soon<lb/>knew all his letters, and began to read
                    short<lb/>words. Peter felt the pleasure of doing good,<lb/>and was so delighted
                    with his brother's read&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>ing, that he never repented the
                    trouble he had<lb/>taken in teaching him. He could, however,<lb/>only spare an
                    hour every evening for his sup&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>per and the lesson,
                    after which he went to the<lb/>forge and made nails until it was time to
                    go<lb/>to bed. The next thing he bought was a slate<lb/>and pencil; this was a
                    new pleasure for little<lb/>David, who tried to make strokes, and
                    amuse<lb/>himself all day with the slate while Peter was<lb/>at school.</p>

                    Billy Jackson in<lb/>the evening, he was sure to see the father and<lb/>mother
                    and all the family sitting down after<lb/>work was over in a clean swept room,
                    while<lb/>Billy, or one of his sisters, read aloud from<lb/>some book, Peter

                    and<lb/>mother to do the same, and he detremined to<lb/>talk to them about it.
                    For some time, Law&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>ley would not listen to anything his
                    son had to<lb/>say on the subject; if ever he had a spare<lb/>hour he went out
                    to a public&ndash;house, where he<lb/>would sometimes spend half a week's
                    earnings<lb/>in one night, and this wastefulness caused so<lb/>much trouble and
                    suffering, that his wife often<lb/>thought there was no use in trying to keep
                    a<lb/>tidy house. She listened, however, to Peter,<lb/>and one evening the room
                    was nicely swept,<lb/>there was a bright fire burning in the clean<lb/>grate,
                    and a chair standing in the warmest<lb/>corner. About an hour before the usual
                    time<lb/>of leaving off, Peter dropped his hammer, and<lb/>begged his father to
                    go indoors. Lawley was<lb/>in a pretty good humour that evening, he<lb/>stood
                    thinking for a minute or two, and then<lb/>followed his son, who hurried to
                    clean himself<lb/>before sitting down. The father seemed<lb/>pleased at finding
                    the room so cheerful&ndash;look&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>ing, his wife was

                    bed&ndash;time; and when he had put away<lb/>his book, and his mother kissed him
                    before<lb/>going up stairs, Peter believed himself to be<lb/>the happiest boy in
                    the world, and felt<lb/>glad and thankful that he had learned to read.<lb/>He
                    lay awake for some time, thinking about <pb n="17"/>

                    <lb/>his new magazine: what a nice thing it was<lb/>to have books to read; how
                    they served to fill<lb/>up the time usefully, especially on dark and<lb/>wet
                    evenings, when there was no going out of<lb/>doors; by and by too, little David
                    would be<lb/>able to take his turn at the book, and with this<lb/>thought in his
                    head Peter fell asleep.</p>
                <p rend="align(justify) first-indent(3)">After this the boy paid more attention
                    than<lb/>ever to his school lessons; the pleasure he had<lb/>felt in his
                    evening's reading encouraged him to<lb/>go on, and it seemed to him that he now
                        posses&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>sed a new power of being useful and
                    making<lb/>others happy. The cheap magazine was pub&ndash;<lb type="inWord"
                    />lished every Saturday, and Peter hoped to be<lb/>able to read something new
                    week after week,<lb/>and have as comfortable evenings as he had<lb/>witnessed at
                    the Jacksons'. But like many<lb/>others, Peter's hopes were
                    disappointed:<lb/>things do not always turn out as we wish at<lb/>the first
                    trial; and a great many evenings pas&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>sed by before his
                    father could be again per&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>suaded to stay at home and
                    listen to the read&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>ing. There was, besides, another
                    trouble:<lb/>Peter had heard Billy Jackson talk of the<lb/>Sunday&ndash;school,
                    and the pleasure of learning<lb/>and singing hymns, and the books lent to
                    the<lb/>scholars to take home to read, and he wished<lb/>very much to go to the
                    school. But his father<lb/>was used to work on Sundays, as well as on<lb/>any
                    other day; he made Peter work too, and<lb/>said the boy had schooling enough all
                    the week,<lb/>without losing Sunday into the bargain. The<lb/>Sabbath, which
                    ought to be a day of rest for<lb/>all, was no day of rest for the Lawleys.
                    Peter<lb/>tried to keep up a good heart, hoping that a <pb n="18"/>

                    <lb/>change for the better would soon come; and<lb/>one evening when there was
                    no work to be<lb/>done, he went to talk about the Sunday&ndash;school<lb/>to
                    Mrs. Jackson.</p>
                <p rend="align(justify) first-indent(3)">A few days afterwards, Mrs. Lawley was
                    a<lb/>good deal surprised at seeing some one walk<lb/>into the house: it was
                    Mrs. Jackson, who said<lb/>that although it was her first call she did
                    not<lb/>feel like a stranger, from her acquaintance with<lb/>Peter. When Mrs.
                    Lawley saw how neatly<lb/>and comfortably her visitor was dressed, she<lb/>felt
                    a little ashamed at not being dressed in<lb/>the same manner. Mrs. Jackson sat
                    down,<lb/>and began to speak of Peter's perseverance,<lb/>and the good use he
                    was making of his school&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>ing, in a way that made Mrs.
                    Lawley feel proud<lb/>of her boy. She then went on to talk of
                    the<lb/>Sunday&ndash;school, and the good her children got<lb/>there, and the
                    pleasure there was at hearing<lb/>them sing their hymns at home in the
                    evenings.<lb/>Mrs. Jackson was not a learned woman, but<lb/>she made the most of
                    her good sense, and<lb/>spoke in such a plain and friendly manner<lb/>about the
                    Sunday&ndash;school, and a place of wor&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>ship, that Mrs.
                    Lawley felt more than half<lb/>inclined to agree with her. Presently,
                        how&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>ever, she asked&mdash;</p>
                <p rend="align(justify) first-indent(3)">&lsquo;But what's the use of going to

                <p rend="align(justify) first-indent(3)">&lsquo;Well, I can't tell you all the good
                    at once,&rsquo;<lb/>answered Mrs. Jackson; &lsquo;but we feel all the<lb/>better
                    and happier for it; and, as my husband<lb/>says, no harm can come of being
                    reminded of<lb/>our duties and having good thoughts put into<lb/>our minds once
                    a week.</p>

                    Lawley; &lsquo;but<lb/>what's the likes of us to do, who havn't got<lb/>decent

                <p rend="align(justify) first-indent(3)">Some further conversation took place
                        be&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>tween the two; and when half&ndash;an&ndash;hour
                        after&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>wards Mrs. Jackson rose to go, Mrs.
                    Lawley<lb/>felt that something might be done if set about<lb/>in the right way.
                    She talked the matter over<lb/>with her husband, and he at last consented
                    to<lb/>let Peter go to the Sunday&ndash;school, though, as<lb/>he said, he did
                    not see how they were to<lb/>live if nobody worked. This permission was<lb/>a
                    new pleasure for Peter, who went to the<lb/>school on the very next Sunday. He
                    wondered<lb/>at the patience of the teachers, and heard of<lb/>things which he
                    had not known before; and<lb/>when the children stood up to sing, he
                    thought<lb/>he had never heard anything so delightful.<lb/>After two or three
                    Sundays, he found out that<lb/>the teachers would be very glad to have
                    his<lb/>sisters and little lame brother at the school.<lb/>He ran home with a
                    full heart to tell his<lb/>mother, and ask her consent. This time his<lb/>father
                    made no objection; the two girls were<lb/>willing to go; Peter said he would
                    carry little<lb/>David on his back, and in this way the whole<lb/>family went to
                    the Sunday&ndash;school, as soon as<lb/>their mother could prepare some tidy

                    instead of that we<lb/>never slept so well in our lives: he is quite<lb/>a
                    blessing to us.&rsquo;</p>
                <p rend="align(justify) first-indent(3)">This conversation took place between
                        Law&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>ley and his wife one fine summer
                    evening,<lb/>about three years after the events recorded in<lb/>the foregoing
                    chapter. They had not long<lb/>come in from a walk to the fields beyond
                    the<lb/>smoky outskirts of the town, where they sat<lb/>under a tree, on a
                    hedgerow bank, while the<lb/>children played about and enjoyed themselves.</p>
                <p rend="align(justify) first-indent(3)">It was very true, as Lawley remarked,
                    his<lb/>wife did appear quite young again. From a<lb/>sloven she had become a
                    pattern of neatness;<lb/>the careworn miserable look which once clouded <pb

                    To the children the mother's eye<lb/>was as a sunshiny day. The house no
                    longer<lb/>appeared the same, every room was as clean as<lb/>sweeping, scouring,
                    and whitewash could make<lb/>it. There were no broken panes in the win&ndash;<lb
                        type="inWord"/>dows filled with old rags, or patched with<lb/>paper, all was
                    sound and tight, and the house,<lb/>though in a dirty neighbourhood, had an
                        or&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>derly and well&ndash;to&ndash;do air about it.
                    The neigh&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>bours used to twit Mrs. Lawley with
                    being<lb/>over&ndash;particular, but she heard their remarks<lb/>with good
                    humour, and though trials of some<lb/>sort would still come, yet she showed how
                    much<lb/>could be done by perseverance. Lawley, too,<lb/>was much changed; his
                    temper was not so<lb/>hasty as formerly, and the gloomy scowl was<lb/>now very
                    seldom seen on his features. But<lb/>what most tended to the comfort and
                        pros&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>perity of the whole family was, that he
                    never<lb/>went out to the public house, but passed his<lb/>evenings at home,
                    where, as he often said, he<lb/>found a thousand times more pleasure than
                    he<lb/>ever had in the tap&ndash;room. Peter had kept on<lb/>through all the
                    discouragements thrown in his<lb/>way, until his father wished to be able to
                    read<lb/>as well as the others; his son worked hard to<lb/>teach him, and in
                    time Lawley could take his<lb/>turn in reading aloud, or in the singing,
                        which&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>ever it might be that was going on after
                    the<lb/>day's work was over. The money that he<lb/>earned was properly laid out:

                    Monday to last the week, and cooked<lb/>without waste. Now that nothing went
                    for<lb/>beer, it was found possible at times to lay by<lb/>a few shillings, and
                    by&ndash;and&ndash;by there was a nest&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>egg of eight or
                    ten pounds in the sayings&rsquo;<lb/>bank. The elder girl no longer worked in
                    the<lb/>forge; Lawley found that with steady habits<lb/>he could earn enough
                    without putting his<lb/>daughter to work at what was not fitted for<lb/>her. She
                    had learned to sew, and do many<lb/>other useful things about a house, and was
                    of<lb/>great service to her mother. The younger<lb/>girl seemed unwilling to
                    leave her old ways,<lb/>and profit by the good example before her, and<lb/>often
                    caused much trouble to her parents;<lb/>but on the other hand they rejoiced to
                    see the<lb/>improvement in little David, who, now that<lb/>he was taken
                    regularly and often into the open<lb/>air, gained strength in his limbs, and
                    could<lb/>walk a little on crutches. He was fonder of<lb/>books than ever; and
                    learned lessons as fast<lb/>as Peter could teach him.</p>
                <p rend="align(justify) first-indent(3)">About this time, Lawley became deeply
                        im&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>pressed with the sudden death of a
                    neighbour<lb/>and companion. This man was a habitual<lb/>visitor at the ale
                    house and gin shop, and had<lb/>carried his drinking propensities so far that
                    at<lb/>length a very dreadful disease, common to<lb/>great drunkards, seized
                    him. He was taken<lb/>with it in the presence of Lawley, who assisted<lb/>to
                    carry him home, where he shortly afterwards<lb/>expired in the most awful
                    agonies of both mind<lb/>and body.</p>

                    He remained very<lb/>thoughtful for some days; and the evening<lb/>after the
                    funeral, while Peter was reading, he<lb/>stopped him short, and declared his
                        determi&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>nation to drink no more strong liquor as
                    long<lb/>as he lived.</p>
                <p rend="align(justify) first-indent(3)">But his resolution was put to a severe
                    trial:<lb/>all the nailers of the neighbourhood, when<lb/>they saw him in the
                    street, came to their doors<lb/>to laugh and jeer at him. They called
                    him<lb/>&lsquo;coward and sneak, afraid of his wife, wouldn't<lb/>be a man, and
                    drink a jug of beer,&rsquo; besides<lb/>many more ill&ndash;natured speeches.
                    Lawley's<lb/>obstinacy, which had often caused him to be<lb/>severe and unjust,
                    now stood him good part,<lb/>for it made him firm in doing right,
                    and<lb/>although he did not like to be laughed at, he<lb/>determined not to give
                    up. At times he felt<lb/>such a strong inclination for beer that he
                    was<lb/>tempted to send Peter for a pint, and drink it<lb/>at home, but his wife
                    encouraged him to per&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>severe in the good cause, and
                    when he felt<lb/>tired made him a nice cup of coffee to cheer<lb/>him. Before
                    long he found that there was a<lb/>little money to spare at the end of the
                    week,<lb/>which put them all beyond the fear of being<lb/>pinched for want of
                    food. This settled the<lb/>question: let his neighbours laugh as much

                    <lb/>content himself with just doing his lessons in<lb/>school, he thought about
                    them at other times,<lb/>and used them as means towards gaining
                    more<lb/>knowledge. His teacher at the Sunday&ndash;school<lb/>took much pains
                    to make him understand the<lb/>Bible stories and lessons which were read
                    in<lb/>the school; and this he did in so simple but<lb/>forcible a manner as to
                    make enduring impres&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>sions of truth and goodness on
                    young Peter's<lb/>mind. He learned of this affectionate
                    and<lb/>earnest&ndash;hearted teacher that religion is not<lb/>that dull and
                    tiresome path, which some who<lb/>have never walked therein say it is, but
                    that<lb/>its ways are pleasantness and peace. He<lb/>learned also that religion
                    is something better<lb/>than mere talk&mdash;that those who are really
                        un&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>der its power are greatly changed in heart
                    and<lb/>life&mdash;that the soul grows more lovely and<lb/>beautiful the more it
                    is fed with heavenly<lb/>truth. Peter not only learned these things in<lb/>his
                    head, but he felt and enjoyed them in<lb/>his heart, and though not outwardly
                    vicious<lb/>before, his conduct towards his parents and<lb/>little brothers and
                    sisters became still more<lb/>dutiful and affectionate, attentive, and
                        oblig&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>ing. The alteration which Peter himself
                    was<lb/>most conscious of was, that he felt so much<lb/>happier now than
                    formerly. His labours at<lb/>the forge, and the trials of patience and

                        learn&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>ed at the Sunday School, the importance
                    of<lb/>always telling the truth was a prominent one,<lb/>of not only avoiding
                    positive lies, but also<lb/>breaking off the disposition to excuse
                    and<lb/>wriggle out of a fault, instead of confessing it<lb/>in a frank and open
                    manner. Peter was some<lb/>time before he could clearly make this
                    out&mdash;it<lb/>had always appeared so easy to make some<lb/>excuse to hide a
                    fault, without caring whether<lb/>it were true or not. But by and by his
                    own<lb/>observation began to confirm the truth of his<lb/>Sabbath lessons, for
                    he saw that those who<lb/>spoke the truth were the most trusted,
                    that<lb/>however humble their station they were always<lb/>believed and
                    respected, and so much more con&ndash;<lb/>tented in mind than those who cheated
                    or told<lb/>lies. At last he made up his mind to try for<lb/>the best; and
                    happen what would from that<lb/>time he never uttered a falsehood. He was
                    very<lb/>industrious; got up early in the morning and<lb/>worked in the forge
                    till breakfast time; this<lb/>gave him money for various things which
                    he<lb/>wanted to improve himself with. He bought<lb/>paper and pencils, and
                    learned to draw; at<lb/>first he tried to copy the pictures in his mag&ndash;<lb
                        type="inWord"/>azines, and afterwards met with an old draw&ndash;<lb
                        type="inWord"/>ing book for a few pence, which was very useful<lb/>to him,
                    and by keeping on with a determina&ndash;<pb n="26" type="inWord"/>

                    <lb/>tion to succeed, he at last could copy buildings,<lb/>machinery, almost
                    everything that he saw.<lb/>He contrived little machines for
                    play&ndash;things<lb/>made of iron, drawing the plans first on<lb/>paper; and by
                    his reading had picked up so<lb/>much information, as to be quite a handy
                    boy<lb/>about the house. He fitted up shelves, fixed<lb/>pegs, mended the floor;
                    in short, all sorts of<lb/>little jobs to please his mother and make
                    the<lb/>house comfortable. Sometimes the things he<lb/>bought were wrapped up in
                    pieces of old<lb/>newspapers, in which he generally found some<lb/>scraps worth
                    cutting out, these were then<lb/>pasted in a book made of a few quires
                    of<lb/>wrapping&ndash;paper, and in this way he got<lb/>together many useful
                    facts which otherwise<lb/>would have been lost. Peter, however, did<lb/>not like
                    the thought of continuing to be a<lb/>nailer, as he said to his father, he could
                    turn<lb/>to nail&ndash;making at any time if other work failed.<lb/>He wanted to
                    get forward in the world, and<lb/>thought that a trade requiring more
                    skill<lb/>would be the most likely means. He wished<lb/>to be a
                    lock&ndash;smith, and after some trouble and<lb/>inquiry, a master was found
                    willing to take<lb/>him, who lived about ten miles from Birming&ndash;<lb
                        type="inWord"/>ham, at one of the manufacturing villages<lb/>common in that
                    part of the country. His<lb/>mother felt sorry at parting with her boy,
                    who<lb/>was such a comfort to the whole family, but<lb/>Peter reminded her that
                    it was all for the best,<lb/>and some day she would rejoice to see him<lb/>come
                    back a skilful workman. And it was<lb/>with a determination to try to do what
                    was<lb/>right, that he said good&ndash;bye to his father, who<lb/>had walked
                    over with him to his new place.</p>

                <p rend="align(justify)">IT is a fine thing to go out into the world, to<lb/>see new
                    places, make new acquaintances, and<lb/>learn a trade by which we may raise
                    ourselves<lb/>to independence, if not to fortune. With<lb/>skill in the hand and
                    knowledge in the head,<lb/>every man possesses a power of advancement<lb/>of
                    which he cannot be deprived; it always re&ndash;<lb/>mains as part of himself.
                    So thought and felt<lb/>Peter for the first day or two after going to<lb/>the
                    place which was to be for a time a new<lb/>scene of labour for him; but things
                    turned<lb/>out very different from his expectation.<lb/>Peter's father had
                    either been deceived as to<lb/>the character of the man with whom he
                        ap&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>prenticed his son, or he had not attached
                        suffi&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>cient importance to the subject. For
                    this<lb/>poor Peter had to suffer. Instead of the<lb/>clean and cheerful home to
                    which he had of<lb/>late been accustomed, his master's house was<lb/>always in a
                    state of confusion; all the house&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>hold duties seemed to
                    be carried on in a gene&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>ral scramble. It was only in
                    the work&ndash;shop<lb/>that any thing like order prevailed, and there<lb/>not
                    constantly, for whenever the employer was<lb/>absent, the workmen and
                    apprentices took care<lb/>to work as little as possible. Beyond their<lb/>trade
                    they knew nothing, and Peter soon<lb/>found that his prospect of adding to his
                    stock<lb/>of knowledge was not so promising as he had<lb/>looked forward to; and
                    had it not been that<lb/>there was one steady man among them, his <pb n="28"/>

                    <lb/> situation would have been very discouraging.<lb/>The master was a coarse,
                    uneducated man,<lb/>who, provided that the work was done to time,<lb/>cared for
                    little besides. He was one of those<lb/>who thought that learning made
                    working&ndash;men<lb/>dangerous and dishonest, or set them above<lb/>their
                    business; and one day that he saw Peter<lb/>reading during part of the time
                    allotted for<lb/>dinner, he snatched the book from the boy's<lb/>hand, and with
                    an angry threat, forbade him<lb/>ever to read again in his presence. This
                    was<lb/>a heavy trial for Peter; at first he felt as<lb/>though the brightest
                    part of his life had be&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>come suddenly clouded, but he
                    was not easily<lb/>cast down, and instead of giving way to dis&ndash;<lb
                        type="inWord"/>contented thoughts, worked on as though no&ndash;<lb
                        type="inWord"/>thing had happened. But where there is a<lb/>will there is a
                    way: and by getting up at four<lb/>o'clock while mornings were light,
                    Peter<lb/>gained two hours for reading, without disturb&ndash;<lb type="inWord"
                    />ing any one in the house.</p>
                <p rend="align(justify) first-indent(3)">It was now that Peter felt the value of
                    the<lb/>habit of steady perseverance, of turning small<lb/>opportunities to
                    account, which he had been<lb/>silently acquiring at home. The few
                    books<lb/>which he had brought with him supplied him<lb/>with matter for
                    thinking about while he was<lb/>at work. Not that he was a dull boy; on
                    the<lb/>contrary, when the time for play came, he was<lb/>always ready to take
                    part in a hearty game of<lb/>leapfrog, cricket, prisoners' base, or any
                    other<lb/>sport. And this healthful exercise in the open<lb/>air, while
                    affording real diversion to Peter and<lb/>the other boys, removed any ill
                    effects of con&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>finement in the workshop. Oftentimes,
                        how&ndash;<pb n="29" type="inWord"/>

                    <fw type="pagenumber" rend="align(right)">29</fw>
                    <lb/>ever, the sport grew mischievous, and ended<lb/>in trespass or depredation
                    on the neighbours'<lb/>property. With this Peter would have no&ndash;<lb
                        type="inWord"/>thing to do; on such occasions he walked out<lb/>by himself,
                    and wherever there was a steam&ndash;<lb/>engine to be seen in the
                    neighbourhood, he<lb/>contrived his walks so as to visit them all one<lb/>after
                    the other. Parker, the steady workman,<lb/>took a great liking for Peter, and
                    taught him<lb/>how to go through his work in the best man<lb/>ner, and knowing
                    the boy's fondness for read&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>ing, frequently invited him
                    to his house in the<lb/>evenings, and lent him such books as he had.<lb/>Among
                    these was a work on the steam&ndash;engine,<lb/>with which Peter was delighted;
                    the same<lb/>love for ingenious contrivances which led him<lb/>to choose the
                    trade of a locksmith, now made<lb/>him feel pleasure in studying machinery;
                    and<lb/>thus it was that, after reading about steam&ndash;<lb/>engines, he
                    walked out to see them at work,<lb/>and made drawings of them, the better to
                        un&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>derstand and remember the differences in
                    their<lb/>construction. In this way he gained a toler&ndash;<lb type="inWord"
                    />able knowledge of machinery, without at all<lb/>neglecting his trade of
                    lockmaking, and he was<lb/>not long in finding out the truth of what
                        Par&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>ker often said, that the more a man knew
                    the<lb/>better workman was he likely to be.</p>
                <p rend="align(justify) first-indent(3)">Peter profited so well by the
                    instructions<lb/>given him, and worked so diligently as to be<lb/>able in the
                    course of a few months to make all<lb/>the parts of a lock in a very creditable
                        man&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>ner. Notwithstanding his steadiness, and
                        be&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>ing always true to time in the workshop,
                    his<lb/>master often said the boy was too quiet to be <pb n="30"/>

                    <lb/>good for much. Peter, however, though often<lb/>wondering at his employer's
                    harshness, knew<lb/>nothing of these suspicions; but he under&ndash;<lb
                        type="inWord"/>went much annoyance from another quarter.<lb/>Among the
                    apprentices, there were two or<lb/>three who disliked and envied him on
                    account<lb/>of his skill and general good character; they<lb/>could not
                    understand why he should refuse to<lb/>join in their brutal sports or ribald
                    talk, and<lb/>they persecuted him accordingly. Peter did<lb/>not feel inclined
                    to quarrel with persons in<lb/>whose company he would have to work
                        proba&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>bly for several years; he reasoned with
                    the<lb/>other boys, and endeavoured to make them<lb/>comprehend that
                    ill&ndash;nature and strife were<lb/>more likely to injure those who displayed
                    such<lb/>feelings, than the person against whom they<lb/>were directed.
                    &lsquo;Study your master's interest,&rsquo;<lb/>he would say to them, &lsquo;and
                    you will best serve<lb/>your own; he who will not do his duty for<lb/>another,
                    will hardly be able to do it for him&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>self.&rsquo; One
                    or two of the boys would perhaps<lb/>have listened to Peter, but they were
                    afraid<lb/>of being laughed at by the others, and where<lb/>people stand in fear
                    of ridicule for taking<lb/>pains to improve themselves, it is a difficult
                    and<lb/>almost hopeless task for them to do right.</p>
                <p rend="align(justify) first-indent(3)">Among the apprentices, there was one
                    boy<lb/>for whom Peter felt much compassion. He<lb/>was a poor little fellow, an
                    orphan, without<lb/>any one to care for him, and he was made the<lb/>drudge of
                    all the shop. In fact, as is often<lb/>the case, what with running here and
                    there,<lb/>bringing this and fetching that, Bob worked a<lb/>great deal harder
                    than many of the men. <pb n="31"/>

                    <lb/>And if, when worn out by fatigue, he ventured<lb/>to complain, he was
                    answered by a blow, or<lb/>some equally severe punishment. Peter often<lb/>felt

                    Nearly<lb/>every voice was raised against him, but Peter<lb/>stood firm, and
                    spoke so feelingly on the sub&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>ject, as to silence, if
                    not convince, the opposi&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>tion. It was a work of time,
                    but he suc&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>ceeded at last, and the poor little boy,
                    who<lb/>came to look upon Peter as his best friend,<lb/>when relieved from the
                    persecution under<lb/>which he had so long suffered, proved to be<lb/>not less
                    expert in such work as he was able to<lb/>perform than the others. So true it is
                    that<lb/>oppression tends to blunt the natural faculties<lb/>and make people
                    appear vicious and stupid.</p>

                    as an apprentice he received no wages,<lb/>and the only money he had was the few
                        shil&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>lings given to him, from time to time, by
                    his<lb/>mother, when he had a holiday and went<lb/>home. He had read his own

                    them nearly by heart, and he could<lb/>borrow no others in the village, so
                    little did<lb/>the people around him care for reading. Peter<lb/>often said to
                    himself, that if he had a little<lb/>more money, he would then be able to
                    buy<lb/>such books as he wanted, for he could not<lb/>stop short in his pursuit

                    <lb/> He only felt what many others have felt, that<lb/>when we once get a
                    little knowledge, it gives<lb/>us a desire for more, and we cannot rest
                        satis&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>fied until we have gained more. He
                    noticed<lb/>that several of the apprentices who, as he, re&ndash;<lb
                        type="inWord"/>ceived no wages, yet appeared to have always<lb/>plenty of
                    money, and one day he asked them<lb/>in what way they obtained it. At first
                    they<lb/>laughed, and refused to tell, thinking he could<lb/>not be ignorant of
                    their practice of appropri&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>ating and carrying off
                    whatever they could lay<lb/>their hands on any where in the neighbour&ndash;<lb
                        type="inWord"/>hood. One of them, however, called Peter a<lb/>fool for not
                    taking care of himself; it was all<lb/>fair, he urged, to cheat a master who did
                    not<lb/>do much for his apprentices. Besides, it was<lb/>so easy to get a little
                    money in this way, and<lb/>nobody would be the wiser. For a moment<lb/>Peter was
                    tempted to believe that the circum&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>stances in which he
                    was placed would justify<lb/>him in following this advice, and the
                    thought<lb/>of getting new books made it appear less<lb/>blameable. It was,
                    however, but for a mo&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>ment: the lessons he had learned
                    and treasured<lb/>in his heart years before at the Sunday School<lb/>came to
                    mind; the love of truth prevailed,<lb/>and happen what would, he would not give
                    way<lb/>to the temptation. Just at this time, Parker,<lb/>who had been to
                    Birmingham, brought back<lb/>with him a few second&ndash;hand books.
                    Among<lb/>these was one on arithmetic; Peter had long<lb/>wished to make himself
                    acquainted with some<lb/>of the higher rules which he had not learned<lb/>at
                    school, and with this book he filled up his<lb/>leisure hours during several
                    months.</p>

                    remained<lb/>much the same as we have here described it, up<lb/>to the end of
                    his second year of apprenticeship.<lb/>His persevering steadiness was not
                    altogether<lb/>lost upon his master; the latter had begun to<lb/>think that the
                    youth was what he appeared to<lb/>be, and now that Peter asked for a holiday,
                    to<lb/>go home and see his parents, he obtained leave<lb/>with less demur than
                    formerly. It was on a<lb/>fine Saturday evening that Peter started with<lb/>a
                    bundle hanging to a stick on his shoulder.<lb/>Being summer, there were several
                    hours of<lb/>daylight before him, and he walked on, glad to<lb/>leave the black
                    village behind, and to find him&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>self under green hedges
                    and leafy trees, undis&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>figured by smoke. With what
                    pleasure he<lb/>looked forward to meeting his father and<lb/>mother, his sisters
                    and little David, how much<lb/>they would be grown, how many things
                    there<lb/>would be to talk, about, something worth tel&ndash;<lb type="inWord"
                    />ling since last they met. The Jacksons, too;<lb/>he would not fail to call
                    upon them before he<lb/>returned on Monday morning. Animated by<lb/>these
                    thoughts, Peter stepped briskly forwards<lb/>until he came to a
                    steam&ndash;engine factory, which<lb/>had not long been built, standing a little
                    way<lb/>out of the road. There was an engine at work<lb/>at one side of the
                    building, of a construction<lb/>different to any that he had before seen,
                    and<lb/>he went up to get a nearer view of it. His<lb/>book and pencil were in
                    his bundle, and Peter<lb/>determined on adding the one he now saw to<lb/>the
                    number of those which he had already<lb/>copied. While he was drawing, a

                    After watching the movements of the<lb/>pencil for a minute or two, he said,
                    &lsquo;Well<lb/>done, my boy, that is a very creditable draw&ndash;<lb

                    him by Parker had first led<lb/>him to think about steam&ndash;engines and
                    how<lb/>they were put together. He opened his book,<lb/>and showed the drawings
                    which he had made<lb/>during his apprenticeship. The gentleman<lb/>turned over
                    the leaves, and commended the<lb/>youth for the correct and workmanlike
                    style<lb/>in which they were executed, and after some<lb/>further questions as
                    to his position and pros&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>pects, inquired whether he

                    The time for paying the men's<lb/>wages had come, and a small bag,
                    containing<lb/>between two and three pounds in silver, was<lb/>missing. The
                    master was positive that he had<lb/>locked it safely in the small closet where
                    he<lb/>usually kept his money, only the day before,<lb/>and now, after searching
                    in every hole and<lb/>corner, it could not be found. The alarm of<lb/>the
                    robbery soon spread; all the men and<lb/>boys were called in from the workshop,
                    and<lb/>questioned concerning the lost money. They<lb/>all professed entire
                    ignorance, except the two<lb/>boys, who regarded Peter with particular
                    dislike.<lb/>One of them said, that he was wakened that<lb/>morning by a noise
                    in the room, where he and<lb/>some other of the apprentices slept, and
                    saw<lb/>Lawley dress himself, and go quietly down<lb/>stairs. He then woke his
                    companion, and<lb/>after a little while, they both saw Peter come<lb/>up again
                    and put something into his box,<lb/>which he locked, and then sat down to
                    read,<lb/>until the hour came for beginning to work.<lb/>They had almost
                    forgotten the circumstance,<lb/>but now, on being questioned, it had

                        pos&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>itively denied all knowledge of it, and
                    when<lb/>the charge against him was repeated, persisted<lb/>in his denial,
                    appealing to his past conduct<lb/>whether such a change in his character
                    would<lb/>be likely to take place all at once. &lsquo;It's all<lb/>very well to

                    have got into<lb/>his box? It must have been put there by<lb/>some one who owed
                    him a spite; beyond<lb/>that all was a mystery. But his conscience<lb/>was clear
                    in the matter, and he could and<lb/>did look up with cheerful confidence to
                    Him<lb/>who hears the prisoner's sigh, and breaks the<lb/>oppressor's rod. He
                    re&ndash;called to memory many<lb/>cheering promises of Holy Writ;

                    <lb/>was still pleasant and suitable. The night<lb/>passed away: the next day as

                    <lb/>morning came: he was again placed in the<lb/>cart between his master and
                    the constable, and<lb/>driven to the magistrate's residence, about
                    three<lb/>miles distant. On arrival here they were shewn<lb/>into an apartment
                    where two gentleman were<lb/>sitting engaged in conversation at a table
                        cov&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>ered with papers. Peter started, and felt
                    ready<lb/>to drop for shame and sorrow, when he recog&ndash;<lb type="inWord"

                    himself<lb/>seemed much astonished to see Peter come in<lb/>as a prisoner. The

                    have seen in the previous chapter,<lb/>declared Peter to be the thief. The
                    constable<lb/>in turn deposed that he had been sent for in<lb/>great haste on
                    discovery of the robbery, and<lb/>explained in what way the culprit had
                    been<lb/>pursued and captured, and ended by saying,<lb/>&lsquo;he didn't think
                    the boy was any better than<lb/>he should be.&rsquo; The case seemed clear
                    enough<lb/>against Peter, and when called upon for what<lb/>he had to say, he
                    was so confused by the evi&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>dence brought forward, and

                    crept down<lb/>stairs so as not to disturb any one, and on<lb/>coming up again
                    put one of the books into his <pb n="41"/>

                    positively denied<lb/>having been near the room in which the money<lb/>was kept,
                    but was quite unable to account for<lb/>the bag of silver found in his box. He
                    ended<lb/>by saying, that as he was alone, he hoped<lb/>time would be given for
                    his father to be sent<lb/>for.</p>
                <p rend="align(justify) first-indent(3)">As Peter ceased, the stranger who had

                    leaned<lb/>across the table and said a few words in a low<lb/>tone to the

                    Lawley,<lb/>appearances are certainly against you. Here<lb/>are two boys who
                    swear as to your having gone<lb/>down stairs at an early hour, before any of
                    the<lb/>household were stirring, and that you came<lb/>softly up again, and
                    locked something in your<lb/>box. But why you should have left the
                    silver<lb/>there, instead of taking it with you, I cannot<lb/>understand. This
                    gentleman tells me he met<lb/>you by chance on Saturday, and formed a
                        favour&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>able opinion of you; I trust he may not
                    be<lb/>deceived, but for the present I can only say<lb/>that you must be
                    detained. It is, however,<lb/>desirable that your father should be sent

                    to make Peter feel<lb/>a little more at ease in his mind; the party
                    were<lb/>just leaving the room when the door opened,<lb/>and Parker and Bob
                    entered; they both looked<lb/>hot and dusty, and were out of breath with <pb

                    said:&mdash;&lsquo;Please your<lb/>honour, don't let them go away, I've got
                        some&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>thing to say in the matter.&rsquo; The
                    locksmith,<lb/>however, was in no hurry to depart, for he<lb/>thought some
                    further evidence was coming out<lb/>against Peter. According to Parker's
                        state&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>ment, Bob had told him on going to work
                    in<lb/>the morning, that the day before he went out<lb/>to walk in the fields,
                    feeling a good deal troub&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>led about what had happened.
                    Coming to the<lb/>edge of an old stone quarry, he lay down in<lb/>the grass, and
                    soon after hearing voices in con&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>versation about Peter,
                    he peeped over, and<lb/>saw the two boys who had been brought for&ndash;<lb
                        type="inWord"/>ward as witnesses, sitting in the hollow beneath.</p>
                <p rend="align(justify) first-indent(3)">They were talking and laughing about
                    the<lb/>clever way in which they had contrived to<lb/>steal the bag of money and
                    place it in Peter's box.<lb/>Something more was said about the pleasure<lb/>of
                    seeing him punished, but this was enough<lb/>for Bob, he stole quietly away; yet
                    for some<lb/>time he could not make up his mind what to<lb/>do as he was
                    &lsquo;put upon&rsquo; by the other hands<lb/>in the workshop, and feared the
                    effects of their<lb/>displeasure. On seeing Parker, however, he<lb/>at once told
                    him what he had heard: Parker<lb/>said not a minute was to be lost, and
                    both<lb/>started hoping to arrive in time to clear up the<lb/>case. Bob was
                    called forward and questioned;<lb/>while he was speaking a change came
                    over<lb/>Peter's face, the look of shame disappeard, his<lb/>eye brightened, and
                    he stood up in proved in&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>tegrity. The locksmith and
                    constable seemed<lb/>puzzled at the unexpected turn of affairs, and <pb n="43"/>

                    <lb/>the two boys who had sworn to the robbery<lb/>tried to brave it out, but
                    their confusion was<lb/>such as to prove them guilty even before ex&ndash;<lb

                <p rend="align(justify) first-indent(3)">The stranger who sat by the table
                    appeared<lb/>to be pleased at this result, and speaking again<lb/>to the
                    magistrate, the latter asked the lock&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>smith, if he were
                    aware that Peter deserved<lb/>some compensation for the grief and
                    disgrace<lb/>he had been made to suffer. The locksmith<lb/>demurred to this;
                    some further conversation<lb/>took place, which ended by the stranger
                    telling<lb/>Peter to go and make himself happy at home<lb/>for a week, at the
                    end of which he would hear<lb/>something further. Peter's joy at being
                    ad&ndash;<lb/>dressed in this way may be imagined; he<lb/>shook hands with
                    Parker, and started off<lb/>homewards brimful of news of all that
                    had<lb/>happened to him.</p>

                    had<lb/>pleased him so much a few days previously.<lb/>Peter jumped at the
                    offer; his father and<lb/>mother expressed their thanks for their
                    visitor's<lb/>kindness; and at the end of the week the boy<lb/>entered his new

                    <lb/>was complete: on taking possession of a little<lb/>bed&ndash;room in the
                    foreman's house, in which it<lb/>was arranged that he should live, he found
                    his<lb/>box and the books which had been left at the<lb/>locksmith's; and in
                    addition a good stock of<lb/>clothes.</p>
                <p rend="align(justify) first-indent(3)">Peter's industry and perseverance in
                    self&ndash;<lb/>education now met with their reward; he was<lb/>at once placed
                    in the draughtsman's office,<lb/>where several young men were always at
                    work<lb/>upon drawings of machinery. In the course<lb/>of his studies he had met
                    with many things<lb/>which he thought would never be of any use<lb/>to him, but
                    now he found out their value;<lb/>these odds and ends of knowledge enabled
                    him<lb/>to understand many things about which he<lb/>would have been at a loss,
                    and so helped him<lb/>forward in his daily tasks. Above all, he felt<lb/>the
                    benefit of his arithmetic, for there is no<lb/>business in which a knowledge of
                    calculation<lb/>will not be useful. The factory was a very<lb/>busy one; engine
                    after engine was turned out<lb/>as fast as they could be made, so that
                    there<lb/>was always plenty of work for those who made<lb/>the drawings. Peter
                    exerted himself to the<lb/>utmost, to show that he was not ungrateful<lb/>for
                    the kindness which had placed him in such<lb/>an improving situation. He was
                    never tired<lb/>of admiring the order that prevailed through<lb/>the whole of
                    the works; every man and boy<lb/>about the place was bound by a system
                    of<lb/>punctuality, very different from the loose way<lb/>in which work had been
                    carried on at the<lb/>locksmith's. Although Peter worked dili&ndash;<lb

                    <lb/>found opportunities of getting an insight into<lb/>the way of constructing
                    machinery, and at<lb/>last knew how to put, a steam&ndash;engine
                    together<lb/>from beginning to end. </p>
                <p rend="align(justify) first-indent(3)">When Peter first went to the factory,
                    he<lb/>thought he had reached the height of his<lb/>wishes, but as he advanced
                    in knowledge and<lb/>skill, so did he aim higher and higher. He<lb/>saw no
                    reason why he should remain a third&ndash;<lb/>rate draughtsman, when he might
                    rise to be<lb/>second, or perhaps first. At all events, there<lb/>was nothing
                    like trying, and this thought en&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>couraged him to
                    conquer many a difficulty.<lb/>Among the numerous workmen employed at<lb/>the
                    factory, there were many about his own<lb/>age, with some of whom, as was
                    natural, he<lb/>became acquainted. Notwithstanding the re&ndash;<lb
                        type="inWord"/>gular hours they were obliged to keep through<lb/>the day, no
                    sooner was work over than their<lb/>spare time was altogether wasted. They
                    never<lb/>thought of the morrow, made no attempt to im&ndash;<lb type="inWord"
                    />prove their minds, or to better their condition.<lb/>Peter, after a little
                    talk, succeeded in persuad&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>ing some of them to meet in
                    the evenings two<lb/>or three times a week, and try what could be<lb/>done
                    towards gaining knowledge. The fore&ndash;<lb/>man promised his assistance, and
                    a small spare<lb/>room at one end of the building, was lent for<lb/>the
                    meetings. Some of the young men could<lb/>not read, those who could took it in

                    wherever it was wanted. The<lb/>principal of the establishment took notice
                    of<lb/>their proceedings, and after a time, finding them<lb/>determined to keep

                    <lb/>room, as it came to be called, with books,<lb/>maps, slates, and drawing
                    materials. In this<lb/>way a class of improving young workmen rose<lb/>up, and
                    they found the truth of what Peter<lb/>had often declared, that the more
                    knowledge<lb/>they gained, the better would they be able to<lb/>perform their
                    work, and as they obtained a<lb/>clearer knowledge of their duties, so did
                    they<lb/>become more trustworthy, by which they pro&ndash;<lb type="inWord"
                    />fited in more ways than one. Peter, in turn,<lb/>felt that doing good to
                    others was one of the<lb/>best means of getting on in the world. It is<lb/>not
                    to be supposed that he was without his<lb/>trials, difficulties, or temptations;
                    but he had<lb/>made up his mind to do his duty whatever<lb/>might happen. He was
                    not above asking for<lb/>information on subjects with which he might<lb/>be
                    unacquainted; what he lacked in genius he<lb/>made up by industry. Before the
                    end of two<lb/>years, he was the most able draughtsman in<lb/>the establishment,
                    and in the absence of the<lb/>principal, took the management of the
                    office,<lb/>where his unassuming manners and cheerful<lb/>disposition gained him
                    the esteem of every<lb/>one.</p>
                <p rend="align(justify) first-indent(3)">At one of the evening meetings, a
                    young<lb/>man from the finishing shop, whom Peter was<lb/>encouraging to
                    persevere with his arithmetic,<lb/>as a means of getting forward, replied,
                    &lsquo;It's<lb/>all very well to talk about getting on, but 'tis<lb/>luck that
                    does it after all.&rsquo; In answer to this<lb/>remark, Peter gave to the class
                    a short state&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>ment of his own history, such as the
                    reader is<lb/>already acquainted with, and concluded&mdash;&lsquo;thus<lb/>you
                    see, I was left to make my own way. I <pb n="47"/>

                    <lb/>could not well be poorer than when I started,<lb/>yet little by little I
                    got on, adding one scrap<lb/>of knowledge to another, and making the most<lb/>of
                    every opportunity for improvement. Had<lb/>I not made up my mind to go to school
                    when<lb/>a boy, I might now have been a drunken nailer.<lb/>Had I not persevered
                    in learning to draw, I<lb/>should not have been taken notice of by
                    our<lb/>generous employer: there was no luck in that.<lb/>We cannot hope to get
                    good situations unless<lb/>we qualify ourselves for them. And even had<lb/>I not
                    risen into my present place, I should<lb/>have been more skilful, better able to
                    fulfil all<lb/>my duties, and more contented as a locksmith,<lb/>with knowledge,
                    than without it. The means<lb/>that I made use of are within the reach
                    of<lb/>every one: have a real desire to get on in the<lb/>world, and you will
                    soon find out the way.&rsquo;<lb/>Here our story may properly be said
                    to<lb/>end: we have followed Peter long enough to<lb/>know that with trust in
                    Providence, and the<lb/>exercise of such principles he had every hope<lb/>of a
                    prosperous and successful career. But<lb/>as some of our readers may wish to
                    know<lb/>something more of his after history, we shall<lb/>by way of conclusion,
                    relate in a few words<lb/>what came to our knowledge respecting him,<lb/>on a
                    recent visit to the scene of his labours.<lb/>&lsquo;Young Lawley,&rsquo; said
                    our informant, &lsquo;is now<lb/>first draughtsman, and for activity and

                    unlikely that he will work him&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>self into a still better
                    position, for he is a<lb/>most persevering fellow; success has not spoiled <pb

                    <lb/>him; in fact he never seems to be happier than<lb/>when he is lending a
                    hand to help others for&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>ward. That is his house there
                    by the side<lb/>of the foreman's, and a comfortable place it<lb/>is, under the
                    care of his wife. She is of an<lb/>excellent disposition and quite worthy of

                    been acquainted with each other many<lb/>years; a happier couple you will hardly
                    find.<lb/>Lame David now keeps a school in the village<lb/>where Peter went to
                    learn lock&ndash;making, and<lb/>his youngest sister lives with him to look
                    after<lb/>his house. The rest of the family still reside<lb/>in Birmingham, the
                    father and the mother are<lb/>getting into years, and not so well able to
                    work<lb/>as formerly; but as they often say, they have<lb/>enough to keep them
                    above want. It is no<lb/>small pleasure to Peter to reflect on all
                    this<lb/>prosperity, the result of a trustful determina&ndash;<lb type="inWord"
