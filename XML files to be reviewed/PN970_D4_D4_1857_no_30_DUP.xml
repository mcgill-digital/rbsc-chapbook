                Its price was<lb/>only &pound;6. The artist was in haste to raise<lb/>a certain sum
                of money, and, in conse&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>quence, wished to dispose of
                several of his<lb/>best pictures at a low price.</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">Richard had a brother, James, who
                was<lb/>unfortunate in many ways. Everything<lb/>seemed to go against him. His
                health<lb/>was shattered, and his wife, a well&ndash;mean&ndash;<lb type="inWord"
                />ing and industrious woman, was always<lb/>ailing. Now this brother, whose
                family<lb/>were on the verge of starvation, had<lb/>requested the loan of &pound;6
                from Richard.<lb/>He and his wife and children were almost<lb/>in rags: they could
                not go to church;<lb/>they were not fit to be seen anywhere.</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">&lsquo; I will try hard to pay you,
                Richard,&rdquo;<lb/>said the poor discouraged man.</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">But Richard knew very well that James<lb/>never
                could pay. He had tried putting<lb/>money into that vessel too many times to<lb/>be
                deceived now with any notion that there<lb/>was a bottom to it.</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">&ldquo; I'll see about it,&rdquo; he replied ;
                &ldquo; wait<lb/>until to&ndash;morrow;&rdquo;and rather moodily<lb/>walked towards

            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">&ldquo; I wonder if it is a man's duty to
                deny<lb/>himself of the <hi rend="italic">necessities of taste</hi>, when<lb/>he has
                fairly earned the means of procur&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>ing them, because other
                men are poorer<lb/>than he ? I think it hard that it should<lb/>be so. I think it
                cannot be right, and I<lb/>declare I will have that picture.&rdquo;</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">Richard took two steps towards the<lb/>door,
                for he had been all this while stand&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>ing outside at the
                window where hung the<lb/>beautiful picture.</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">&ldquo; But your brother!&rdquo; said

            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">&ldquo; I can't be helping him for ever.
                He<lb/>ought to have done as I did, when he was<lb/>a boy. I studied ; he would not.

                when I strove<lb/>day and night for the knowledge which<lb/>should fit me for a high

                Jim must<lb/>have this money. I must give it up.<lb/>Yes, and I must work, and work,
                year in<lb/>and year out, and all my surplus funds<lb/>must go to keep his family
                from starvation<lb/>and want. I, meantime, who am mingling<lb/>in society which
                knows that my means for<lb/>living are as good as any man's need be,<lb/>must live
                in a style which shall appear<lb/>parsimonious in the extreme; and all<lb/>because
                of this sinking fund, of which I<lb/>must never speak. I declare it's a
                hard<lb/>case!&rdquo;</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">Richard was very angry. His
                partner<lb/>wondered to see his usually placid mate in<lb/>such an excited frame of
                mind. But he<lb/>wisely refrained from making any remark.</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">By&ndash;and&ndash;by Richard asked, feeling as

            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">&ldquo; The text was, &lsquo; Bear one
                another's<lb/>burdens,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Richard's partner, not<lb/>observing the
                sudden colour which flushed<lb/>the face of his hearer ; &ldquo;and the minister

                the good and thankful, but<lb/>also to the unworthy. He said men often<lb/>feel that
                it is very hard that they should<lb/>be required to deny themselves, and
                work<lb/>for and care for those who, if they would<lb/>wisely and carefully do their
                own duty,<lb/>might get along without help. But when<lb/>a man from sincere love for
                his brother<lb/>does, to his own cost and wearing, bear<lb/>the brother's burdens,
                and do him all the<lb/>good he can, he is exhibiting <hi rend="italic">the
