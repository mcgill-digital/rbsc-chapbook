                years old; she was, in many<lb/>respects, a very good little girl. She
                was<lb/>obedient, affectionate to her friends, and<lb/>obliging and kind ; but she

                a transport<lb/>of fury, and tear and strike whatever was<lb/>in her way. One day,
                as her mamma<lb/>was passing the nursery door, she heard<lb/>a great noise within,
                and her little Harriet's<lb/>voice speaking in a tone that made her<lb/>sure she was
                wrong. She opened the door,<lb/>and there saw Harriet, with her little
                face<lb/>swelled and distorted with rage, her curly<lb/>hair all in disorder, while
                with her feet<lb/>and hands she was kicking and striking<lb/>with all her force at
                one of the servants,<lb/>and crying out, &ldquo; I don't love you, Mary<lb/>I <hi

                her<lb/>little new jug; when I forbade her, she<lb/>threw the water that was in the
                jug in my<lb/>face, and when I attempted to take hold of<lb/>her, to carry her to
                you, as you desired<lb/>when she did wrong, she flew at me and<lb/>struck me, as you
                have seen.&rdquo; Mrs. M.<lb/>looked very grave, and lifting the sobbing<lb/>Harriet
                in her arms, carried her into her<lb/>own room.</p>

                solemn voice told her to repeat after<lb/>her the following words: &ldquo; Oh, my

                my little wicked heart; drive<lb/>away this bad spirit; help me with Thy<lb/>good
                spirit, and pardon me for the evil I<lb/>have done this day, for Christ Jesus'
                sake,<lb/>Amen.&rdquo; Harriet trembled exceedingly,<lb/>but she repeated the words
                after her mo&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>ther ; and as she did so, in her heart
                she<lb/>wished that God might hear them.</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">Her mamma then asked if her rage<lb/>was gone.
                Harriet answered in a soft<lb/>voice, &ldquo; Not quite, mamma, but it
                is<lb/>better.&rdquo; &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said her mother,<lb/>&ldquo; I shall
                now tell you a story that I was<lb/>told when I was young, and I hope it
