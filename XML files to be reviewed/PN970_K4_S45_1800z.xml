                    through it, a &slong;ort of<lb/>plea&slong;ing melancholy. Three hills in the

                    Whil&slong;t they advanced<lb/>towards one of the huts, they perceived a flock

                    On entering the cabin they were, amazed to &slong;ee<lb/> the order and

                    &slong;he fini&slong;hed her<lb/>narration by taking him to be a witne&slong;s
                    of the inviolable<lb/>fidelity &slong;he owed her hu&slong;band. At the&slong;e
                    words a deep<lb/>con&slong;ternation appeared in their looks. The Count's
                    &slong;on<lb/>bur&slong;ting with grief, threw him&slong;elf into a corner of
                    the hut<lb/>to give a loo&slong;e to his &slong;orrows. His father laid
                    him&slong;elf<lb/>down by him and ca&slong;ting his eyes on Adelaide,
