                    looking wife and fine family of<lb/>children, very &ldquo; black, but

                    warm welcome<lb/>and plenty of food from this friendly<lb/>couple, till they
                    were able to proceed.</p>
                <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">They had a large garden, cultivated
                    by<lb/>the wife, with yams, sweet potatoes, and<lb/>other vegetables growing in
                    it, and all<lb/>surrounded by a fine hedge of the banian&ndash;<lb type="inWord"
                    />tree. Under some larger trees, in the<lb/>middle of the yard, stood the huts
                    in<lb/>which they lived, and no doubt the fine&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>looking
                    little black children played many<lb/>happy days under their mother's care
                    in<lb/>the shade.</p>

                    of<lb/>this interesting family, the wife asked him<lb/>to bring her some cloth
                    from the white<lb/>man's country. When he returned, after<lb/>a long journey, he
                    was surprised to find<lb/>the pleasant home silent and deserted;<lb/>the garden
                    given up to wild weeds, and<lb/>the huts in ruins, and no sign of life
                    in<lb/>the spot where he last saw a large family<lb/>of frolicking children.

                    reminds him<lb/>of his loss. If ever he visits the spot<lb/>again, it is to pray
                    to his dead wife and<lb/>make some offering. So for want of a<lb/>knowledge of
                    the Friend of Sinners, who<lb/>binds up the wounded heart, they must<lb/>move
                    from place to place, and can never<lb/>have any settled villages in that part

                    to live so as to meet their mother<lb/>in heaven. Instead of flying from

                    during a part of the year, gain<lb/>their living by collecting the eggs
                    and<lb/>feathers of the rock&ndash;birds who make their<lb/>nests in the

                <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">The method these people pursue is this
                    :<lb/>selecting a cliff, they drive a crowbar into<lb/>the ground a few feet
                    from the precipice.<lb/>To this they attach a rope; fastening the<lb/>rope to
                    his body, the man will lower him&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>self till he reaches

                <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">In doing this, the adventurer is
                    often<lb/>in great peril. In one instance, a man<lb/>who was thus employed, in
                    gaining a<lb/>narrow ledge of rock which jutted under<lb/>the overhanging cliff,
                    secured his footing<lb/>and began his work. Discovering a full<lb/>nest on an
                    almost inaccessible point, he<lb/>swung himself to it; but in his
                    eagerness<lb/>to grasp the eggs, he accidently unloosed<lb/>the rope attached to
                    his waist, and in an<lb/>instant it swung out beyond his reach.<lb/>He at once
                    saw his danger: no one could<lb/>come to his relief, or even hear his
                    cries.<lb/>He must starve to death where he stood,<lb/>or be dashed to pieces on
                    the rocks hun&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>dreds of feet below.</p>
                <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">Turning round in his terror, he saw
                    the<lb/>rope as it swung to and fro, but it was<lb/>far beyond his reach in its
                    long vibrations. <pb n="8"/>

                    it in agony when he noticed<lb/>that every moment of the rope was
                    shorter<lb/>than the preceding, and that it would soon<lb/>hang motionless.</p>
                <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">He reasoned thus: &ldquo;That rope is

                    I may grasp it;&rdquo;<lb/>and with the thought he sprang from the<lb/>ledge as
                    the rope again swung towards<lb/>him, caught it, and with desperate
                    effort<lb/>ascended, hand over hand, in safety to<lb/>the top.</p>
