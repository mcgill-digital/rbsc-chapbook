            <p rend="first-indent(1) align(justify)">SO said a respectable fatherly&ndash;<lb
                    type="inWord"/>looking old man in the town of<lb/>B&mdash;, in England.</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">I had taken a handful of tracts<lb/>and gone
                out to visit in the district<lb/>where I lived, to speak of Jesus,<lb/>and to invite
                the perishing ones to<lb/>hear the story of his matchless love<lb/>to sinners.</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">On knocking at one door,
                my<lb/>fatherly&ndash;looking friend presented<lb/>himself. I asked him kindly if
                he<lb/>would accept of a tract. He said<lb/>&ldquo;No, I don't believe in your
                way.&rdquo;<lb/>I said &ldquo;No, I don't believe in my<lb/>own way.&rdquo;</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">My old friend stared at me as if<lb/>I had been
                an apparition from the<lb/>spirit world. I remained silent <pb n="3"/> until the
                silence became painful.<lb/>My friend was bewildered. I said<lb/>&ldquo; I did
                believe in my own way for<lb/>the first twenty years of my life, and<lb/>I'll tell
                you what my own way was.<lb/>I was well brought up by Christian<lb/>parents, went
                regularly to church<lb/>from my infancy, and joined the<lb/>church when I became old
                enough;<lb/>I often read my Bible and said my<lb/>prayers; I never did any one
                any<lb/>harm; I always paid my way&mdash;in<lb/>short, I was <hi rend="italic">doing
                    my best</hi>.&rdquo;</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">&ldquo; Well,&rdquo; said my friend, &ldquo;I
                think<lb/>that was a very good way.&rdquo;</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;I thought
                so<lb/>too; but I found it was not <hi rend="italic">God's<lb/>way</hi>. I found it
                written in God's<lb/>word, &lsquo;Verily, verily, I say unto<lb/>thee, except a man
                be born again<lb/>he cannot see the kingdom of God&rsquo;<lb/>(John <num type="roman numeral">iii</num>. 3).
                &lsquo;He that believeth<lb/>not is condemned already&rsquo; (verse 18);<lb/>&lsquo;
                He that believeth not the Son shall<lb/>not see life; but the wrath of God <pb n="4"
                /> abideth on him&rdquo; (verse 36). &lsquo;He<lb/>that believeth not shall be
                damned &rsquo;<lb/>(Mark <num type="roman numeral">xvi</num>. 16). &lsquo; Now to him that<lb/>worketh is the reward
                not reckoned<lb/>of grace, but of debt; but to him<lb/>that worketh not, but <hi
                    rend="italic">believeth</hi> on<lb/>Him that justifieth the ungodly,
                his<lb/>faith is counted for righteousness&rsquo;<lb/>(Romans <num type="roman numeral">iv</num>. 4, 5). I found my
                way<lb/>was in direct opposition to <hi rend="italic">God's<lb/>way</hi>. I was on
                the <hi rend="italic">doing line</hi>, and<lb/>that is the down line to dark
                    dam&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>nation.&rdquo; &ldquo; By the deeds of the
                law<lb/>there shall be no flesh justified in<lb/>his sight &rdquo; (Romans <num type="roman numeral">iii</num>.
                20.)</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">My friend believed in a salvation<lb/>without
                faith and a religion without<lb/>Christ. He would not simply<lb/>receive it as the
                gift of God by faith,<lb/>who says, &ldquo; look unto Me and be ye<lb/>saved&rdquo;
                (Isaiah <num type="roman numeral">xlv</num>. 22).</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">Do you believe in your own way<lb/>or in God's
                way? Which? God's<lb/>testimony of us is that &ldquo;we have<lb/>turned every one to
                his own way &rdquo; <pb n="5"/> (Isaiah l<num type="roman numeral">iii</num>. 6). That is the broad<lb/>way (Matthew
                <num type="roman numeral">vii</num>. 13), and it leads<lb/>to destruction just as surely as God<lb/>has said it.
                Your way may <hi rend="italic">seem</hi><lb/>right. &ldquo; There is a way
                which<lb/>seemeth right unto a man, but the<lb/>ends thereof are the ways of
                death<lb/>(Proverbs <num type="roman numeral">xiv</num>. 12). Jesus says, &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">I<lb/>am the
                    way</hi>&rdquo; (John <num type="roman numeral">xiv</num>. 6). &ldquo;He<lb/><hi rend="italic">that hath</hi>
                the Son <hi rend="italic">hath life</hi>; and he<lb/>that <hi rend="italic">hath
                    not</hi> the Son of God <hi rend="italic">hath<lb/>not life</hi>&rdquo; (I John
                <num type="roman numeral">v.</num> 12).</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">Now, I think I hear you say&mdash;<lb/>&ldquo;
                But you know I have been well<lb/>brought up, and I know my
                Bible<lb/>well.&rdquo;</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">Yes; but that is just your own<lb/>way. You are
                too far up to take<lb/>Christ, as a lost perishing sinner;<lb/>but, like little
                Zaccheus, you must<lb/><hi rend="italic">come down</hi>. Nicodemus was
                well<lb/>brought up; but with all his up&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>bringing, he was
                going to hell, right<lb/>to hell. Up&ndash;bringing will prove<lb/>but a rotten twig
                to hold on to for <pb n="6"/> salvation, &ldquo;for there is none other<lb/>name
                under heaven given among<lb/>men whereby we must be saved &rdquo;<lb/>(Acts <num type="roman numeral">iv</num>. 12)
                but the &ldquo;name of Jesus<lb/>Christ of Nazareth&rdquo; (verse 10).<lb/>Jesus
                says, &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">I am the way</hi>.&rdquo; But<lb/>you say, &ldquo; I
                am not an unbeliever.<lb/>I believe the Bible, and have always<lb/>believed in
                Christ.&rdquo;</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">&ldquo; Then you are saved ?&rdquo;</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">&ldquo; Oh no, I cannot say
                that&mdash;it<lb/>would be great presumption in me<lb/>to say that.&rdquo;</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">But God says it; and whether is<lb/>it more
                presumptuous to take God<lb/>at His word or <hi rend="italic">make Him a liar
                ?</hi><lb/>(I John <num type="roman numeral">v</num>. 10). It is one thing to<lb/>believe that Christ came into
                the<lb/>world more than eighteen hundred<lb/>years ago, and died to save sinners
                ;<lb/>it is quite another thing, as a lost<lb/>sinner, to believe on Him as
                my<lb/>personal Saviour. I may believe<lb/>that my dinner is on the
                table<lb/>waiting for me; but that will not <pb n="7"/> satisfy me&mdash;I must
                really partake<lb/>or die. So it is not believing <hi rend="italic"
                >about</hi><lb/>Christ, but believing <hi rend="italic">on</hi> Him,
                &ldquo;and<lb/>he that believeth on the Son <hi rend="italic">hath<lb/>everlasting
                    life</hi>&rdquo; (John <num type="roman numeral">iii</num>. 36).<lb/>Mark the word <hi rend="italic"
                    >h&ndash;a&ndash;t&ndash;h</hi> &ldquo;hath ever&ndash;<lb type="inWord"
                />lasting life.&rdquo; God says so.</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">But you say, &ldquo; I am a member of<lb/>the
                Church.&rdquo; Very good, if you are<lb/>saved ; but if you are
                unconverted,<lb/>your taking the sacrament is one of<lb/>the blackest sins under
                heaven. It<lb/>is eating and drinking judgment to<lb/>yourself (I Cor. <num type="roman numeral">xi</num>. 29).
                    Church&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>membership is not Christ. Jesus<lb/>says,
                &ldquo; <hi rend="italic">I am the way</hi>.&rdquo;</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">At the close of a gospel meeting<lb/>lately I
                was asked to speak to an<lb/>anxious woman. When I got<lb/>through the many that
                were there<lb/>to where she was sitting, she<lb/>grasped me by the hand, and
                with<lb/>streaming eyes, and choking with<lb/>emotion, she said, &ldquo; Oh sir, I
                have<lb/>been a member of the Church for <pb n="8"/> twenty&ndash;four years, and I
                never knew<lb/>till to&ndash;night that I am a lost sinner ; &rdquo;<lb/>and as she
                buried her face in her<lb/>handkerchief, she sobbed out, &ldquo; O<lb/>what must I
                do to be saved ? &rdquo;</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">I pointed her to the Lamb of<lb/>God,
                &ldquo;who His own self bare our<lb/>sins in His own body on the tree&rdquo;<lb/>(I
                Peter <num type="roman numeral">ii</num>. 24). She saw that<lb/>&ldquo; while we were yet sinners, Christ<lb/>died
                for us&rdquo; (Rom. <num type="roman numeral">v</num>. 8). She<lb/>believed and lived. The smile of<lb/>heaven was
                on her face, her yet<lb/>undried tears sparkled under the<lb/>Sun of Righteousness
                like the dew<lb/>under the morning sun. I left her<lb/>rejoicing in the Lord. This
                is God's<lb/>way of saving sinners.</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">Have done with your own way,<lb/>your own
                doing, your upbringing,<lb/>and your religiousness. None of<lb/>these will
                save&mdash;all put together<lb/>cannot save you. Jesus says, &ldquo; I<lb/>am the
                Way.&rdquo;</p>
