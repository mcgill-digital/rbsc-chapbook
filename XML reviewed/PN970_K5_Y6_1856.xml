            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">LAURA SINCLAIR was an intelligent<lb/>girl,
                studiously devoted to all her les&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>sons except arithmetic.
                That to her was<lb/>a hard, dry study. One pleasant morn&ndash;<lb type="inWord"
                />ing, she had seated herself near the sum&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>mer&ndash;house
                in the garden, to be away from<lb/>the children's noise, and attempted to
                fix<lb/>her mind upon the to her uninteresting<lb/>study ; but a hard sum, upon
                which she<lb/>was engaged, overcame her patience,<lb/>and she threw down her slate
                and book<lb/>in a pet. Her mother at that moment<lb/>came to the door which looked
                into the<lb/>garden. &ldquo; Oh, mother,&rdquo; she exclaimed,<lb/>&ldquo; this is
                arithmetic day ; how I hate it !&rdquo;</p>

            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">&ldquo; My daughter, do not make use
                of<lb/>such expressions,&rdquo; replied her mother.<lb/>&ldquo; Nothing is wanting
                but close attention<lb/>and perseverance, to make that study as<lb/>agreeable as any
                other. If you pass<lb/>over a rule carelessly, and say you un&ndash;<lb
                    type="inWord"/>derstand it from want of energy to learn<lb/>it, you will always
                find it difficult, I<lb/>speak with feeling on this subject, for<lb/>when I went to
                school, a fine arithmeti&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>cian shared the same desk with
                myself,<lb/>and whenever I was perplexed by a dif&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>ficult
                sum, instead of applying to the<lb/>teacher for an explanation, I asked
                    Ame&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>lia to do it for me. She was too obli&ndash;<lb
                    type="inWord"/>ging, and complied. The consequence<lb/>is, that even now I am
                often compelled<lb/>to refer to your father in trifling calcu&ndash;<lb
                    type="inWord"/>lations. I expect much assistance from<lb/>your perseverance,
                Laura,&rdquo; continued<lb/>she, affectionately taking her hand.</p>

                Instead of being<lb/>angry because she could not understand<lb/>her figures, she
                tried to clear her brow<lb/>to understand them better ; and her tu&ndash;<lb
                    type="inWord"/>tor was surprised to find her mind rap&ndash;<lb type="inWord"
                />idly opening to comprehend the more<lb/>difficult rules. She now felt the
                    pleas&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>ure of self&ndash;conquest, besides the
                    enjoy&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>ment of her mother's approbation,
                and<lb/>steadily gave herself up to the several<lb/>branches of mathematics.</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">Laura was the eldest of four children,<lb/>one
                an infant, who had been born to the<lb/>luxuries of wealth. Mr. Sinclair was
                a<lb/>merchant of respectable connexions, and<lb/>had been successful in business,
                with ev&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>ery prospect of a competency to retire<lb/>upon in
                his declining years. But, alas !<lb/>how uncertain all human calculations !<lb/>He,
                late one afternoon, received word<lb/>by telegraph that an extensive

            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">A nervous temperament and a delicate<lb/>system
                were soon sadly wrought upon<lb/>by this misfortune. Mr. Sinclair's
                mind,<lb/>perplexed and harassed, seemed sinking<lb/>under the weight of anxiety.
                Laura was<lb/>at this period sixteen years of age. Her<lb/>mind was clear and
                vigorous, and seemed<lb/>resting, like a young fawn, for its first<lb/>bound. A
                portion of her time was de&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>voted to the instruction of her

                with their wild gambols were<lb/>playing round the room, Mr. Sinclair

                she<lb/>took one on her lap, and the other by<lb/>her knee, and whispering to them a
                little<lb/>story, calmed them to sleepiness, and<lb/>then put them to bed. When Mrs.
                    Sin&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>clair had left the room, Laura laid down<lb/>her
                book, and stood by her father.</p>

                was sitting in the parlor, that the<lb/>children came running up to me and<lb/>asked

                and I then<lb/>commenced : Mary had a white dove, of<lb/>which she was very fond.
                Whenever<lb/>Mary was good, the dove was very hap&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>py, and
                would discover in various ways<lb/>his approbation ; but when she was not<lb/>good,
                the bird would droop its head and<lb/>seem very melancholy. The only way<lb/>in
                which Mary could comfort it, was to<lb/>make sincere resolutions to be better
                in<lb/>future. She always carried it about with<lb/>her, and indeed the dove was
                never wil&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>ling to be absent from her even for a<lb/>moment.
                If she did the least wrong, it<lb/>silently reproved her. She would often<lb/>act
                contrary to the wishes of the bird,<lb/>and then she always felt unhappy ;
                but<lb/>when she had the dove's approbation,<lb/>she was full of gladness.</p>

                is a friend that we all have within<lb/>our own hearts, and if we obey its
