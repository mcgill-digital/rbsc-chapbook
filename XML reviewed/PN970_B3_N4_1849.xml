            <p rend="indent(2) align(justify)">Once on a time, Merlin, a famous<lb/>magician, was
                traveling, and being<lb/>weary, he stopped at a plowman&rsquo;s<lb/>cottage to ask
                lor some refreshment.<lb/>The plowman&rsquo;s wife kindly brought<lb/>him a bowl of
                milk, and a wooden<lb/>plate of good brown bread, which she<lb/>urged him to partake
                of.</p>
            <p rend="indent(2) align(justify)">Merlin could not help seeing, that<lb/>the honest
                couple looked quite sad<lb/>and sorrowful; so he asked the cause,<lb/>and learned
                that they had no chil&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>dren ; the wife declaring, with
                tears<lb/>in her eyes, that she should be happy<lb/>if she had a son, even if he
                were no<lb/>bigger than his father&rsquo;s thumb !</p>
            <p rend="indent(2) align(justify)">Merlin was much amused with the<lb/>idea of a boy no
                bigger than a man&rsquo;s<lb/>thumb, and sending for the queen of<lb/>the fairies,
                he told her of the desire<lb/>of the plowman&rsquo;s wife. The queen<lb/>was no less
                pleased than Merlin, and<lb/>she said the wish should be granted. <pb n="8"/>

                the size of<lb/>his father&rsquo;s thumb, and was named<lb/>by the queen, TOM
                THUMB.</p>
            <p rend="indent(2) align(justify)">One day his mother was making a<lb/>pudding, and that
                he might see how<lb/>it was made, Tom climbed on the top<lb/>of the bowl; but his
                foot happening<lb/>to slip, he fell over head and ears into<lb/>it, and his mother
                not seeing him,<lb/>she stirred him into the batter, and<lb/>then popped the whole
                into the pot.</p>
            <p rend="indent(2) align(justify)">The hot water made Tom kick<lb/>and struggle, and his
                mother, seeing<lb/> the pudding jump up and down in<lb/>the pot, thought it was
                bewitched.<lb/>A pedlar going by at that moment,<lb/>she gave him the pudding, which
                he<lb/>put in his pack and then walked on.<lb/>As soon as Tom could get the
                batter<lb/>out of his mouth, he began to cry out.<lb/>This so frightened the pedler
                that he<lb/>flung the pudding over a fence, and<lb/>took to his heels. The pudding
                was<lb/>broken by the fall, and poor Tom<lb/>crawled out and ran home.</p>

                had lost his own,<lb/>he used to creep into his playmates&rsquo;<lb/>bags, fill his
                pockets, and come out to<lb/>play again. One day, as he was doing<lb/>this, the

                gave<lb/>him a little golden palace to live in,<lb/>and also a tiny coach, which

                pay his<lb/>parents a visit, and take with him<lb/>as much money as he could
                carry!<lb/>Accordingly, Tom procured a little<lb/>purse, and putting a sixpence
                into<lb/>it, he with much labor and difficulty<lb/>got the purse upon his back
                and<lb/>started for home.</p>
