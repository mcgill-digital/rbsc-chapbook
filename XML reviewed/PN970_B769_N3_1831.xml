             <p rend="first-indent(3) align(justify)"><hi rend="italic"> The Queen Bee. </hi>The
                royal<lb/>insect passes three days in the<lb/>egg, is five a worm, when the
                bees<lb/>close its cell, and it immediately<lb/>begins to cocoon, which is
                finished<lb/>in twenty&ndash;four hours. During<lb/>eleven days, and even
                sixteen<lb/>hours of the twelfth, it remains<lb/>in a state of complete repose.
                Its<lb/>transformation into a nymph then<lb/>takes place, in which state
                four<lb/>days and part of a fifth are pass&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>ed. On the fifth
                day after her <pb n="6"/>
                <fw type="pagenumber" rend="align(centre)">4</fw> appearance the queen quits
                the<lb/>hive for the purpose of fecunda&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>tion :
                forty&ndash;six hours afterwards<lb/>she begins to lay eggs, and a hive<lb/>will
                often consist of forty thousand<lb/>inhabitants, the most of them her<lb/>own
                offspring. The first eggs of<lb/>the queen always give birth to<lb/>workers. In
                spring she lays about<lb/>two thousand eggs of males, re&ndash;<lb type="inWord"
                />sumes it again in August, but dur&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>ing the rest of the
                intervals she<lb/>exclusively lays workers' eggs.&mdash;<lb/>It is curious that
                oviposition is re&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>tarded by cold;during winter it
                does<lb/>not take place. Huber relates an<lb/>instance where a queen instead
                of<lb/>laying her eggs 46 hours after fe&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>cundation, did not
                do so for seve&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>ral months, owing to her impregna&ndash;<lb
                    type="inWord"/>tion having taken place just before<lb/>winter. The queen must be
                at least <pb n="7"/>
                <fw type="pagenumber" rend="align(centre)">5</fw> eleven months old before she
                    be&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>gins to lay the eggs of males.&mdash;<lb/>The bees
                both workers and queen,<lb/>know the period of oviposition<lb/>proper for each kind
                of egg, and<lb/>take care to provide suitable cells<lb/>at a proper period. Huber
                    re&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>moved all the workers' cells from<lb/>a hive, and
                left nothing but the<lb/>male cells; the bees, instead of<lb/>repairing the damage
                done to the<lb/>hive, by uniting the fragments of<lb/>comb, seemed quite
                disheartened,<lb/>went into the field, but returned<lb/>unladen. The queen too,
                    hesitat&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>ed about laying her worker eggs<lb/>in the
                large male cells, and at last<lb/>they were seen to drop from her<lb/>at random.
                However, six eggs<lb/>were deposited regularly; but the<lb/>workers did not treat
                them very<lb/>carefully. They were removed <pb n="8"/>
                <fw type="pagenumber" rend="align(centre)">6</fw> next day, and the cells left
                empty.<lb/>In order to re&ndash;animate them, he<lb/>gave the bees a piece of
                comb,<lb/>composed of workers' cells, but<lb/>which were filled with male
                    in&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>stead of workers' eggs. For twelve<lb/>days the bees
                obstinately abstain&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>ed from working in wax, but at<lb/>last
                they positively removed the<lb/>whole of the male brood, and clean&ndash;<lb
                    type="inWord"/>ed the cells, just as if they had<lb/>been aware that the eggs
                which<lb/>were to come from the queen re&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>quired worker
                cells. As soon as<lb/>this was done, the queen no lon&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>ger
                dropped her eggs at random,<lb/>but deposited them in the cells.&mdash;<lb/>The male
                cells were then taken<lb/>away, and the worker cells restor&ndash;<lb type="inWord"
                />ed; upon which the ordinary la&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>bors of the hive were

                are<lb/>three substances for which bees<lb/>forage during their excursions from the

                from that part<lb/>of the flower called the nectarium.<lb/>For the purpose of
                collecting this<lb/>fluid substance, the insect is fur&ndash;<lb type="inWord"

                a<lb/>tube, by which the fluid is to be<lb/>sucked up, but like a tongue,
                to<lb/>lick away the honied juice which<lb/>nature has secreted in little
                glands<lb/>which were always known to the<lb/>bee, although they had, until
                a<lb/>very recent period, completely e&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>luded the researches
                of the most<lb/>skilful botanists. From the tongue<lb/>this sweet juice is conveyed
                to<lb/>the mouth; it then passes through<lb/>the gullet into the first stomach,

                the cells.<lb/>Sometimes the insect may be seen<lb/>delivering its surplus store to
                    an&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>other bee, which appears ready to<lb/>receive it at

                during<lb/>the winter with treacle; but no<lb/>proper substitute has yet
                been<lb/>found for this bee&ndash;bread. When<lb/>deprived of this necessary of
                life,<lb/>they become consumptive and die.<lb/>The gathering of the pollen
                    af&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>fords a striking illustration of the<lb/>means
                indirectly employed by na&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>ture to second her purposes.
                The<lb/>pollen is the fertilizing dust of<lb/>flowers; it is necessary for
                some<lb/>of it to fall on a particular part of<lb/>the pistil, in order that the
                flower<lb/>shall give place to fruit, inclosing<lb/>the seed of a future plant.
                Now,<lb/>it has been remarked by a great<lb/>number of naturalists, that the
                bee,<lb/>when it collects the pollen from<lb/>one plant, does not go to a
                    differ&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>ent sort of plant for more, but, la&ndash;<lb
                    type="inWord"/>boring to collect the same kind of <pb n="16"/>
                <fw type="pagenumber" rend="align(centre)">14</fw> fertilizing dust, it seeks only
                the<lb/>same kind of flowers. Since the<lb/>foundation of the vegetable
                    king&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>dom is effected in no small degree<lb/>through the
                medium of insects,<lb/>which, while searching for their<lb/>own food, unconsciously
                sprinkle<lb/>the fertilizing pollen on the re&ndash;pro&ndash;<lb type="inWord"
                />ductive organs of plants, it follows,<lb/>that had the bee gone from one<lb/>kind
                of flower to another, this<lb/>would given rise to hybrid plants,<lb/>and thus have
                counteracted the<lb/>purpose of nature. <hi rend="italic">Murray' s Fam&ndash;<lb

                fine<lb/>spring days, in which the sun is<lb/>beautiful and warm, duels
                may<lb/>often be seen to take place be&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>tween two
                inhabitants of the same<lb/>hive. In some cases, the quarrel<lb/>appears to have
                begun within, and <pb n="17"/>
                <fw type="pagenumber" rend="align(centre)">15</fw> the combatants may be seen
                    com&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>ing out of the gates eager for blows.<lb/>Sometimes
                a bee peaceably settled<lb/>on the outside of the hive, or walk&ndash;<lb
                    type="inWord"/>ing about is rudely jostled by<lb/>another, and then the attack
                    com&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>mences, each endeavoring to ob&ndash;<lb
                    type="inWord"/>tain the most advantageous posi&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>tion.
                They turn, pirouettle, throt&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>tle each other; and such is
                their<lb/>bitter earnestness, that Reaumur<lb/>has been enabled to come
                near<lb/>enough to observe them with a<lb/>lens without causing a
                separation.<lb/>After rolling about in the dust,<lb/>the victor, watching the time
                when<lb/>its enemy uncovers his body by<lb/>elongating it, in the attempt
                to<lb/>sting, thrusts its weapon between<lb/>the scales, and the next instant
                its<lb/>antagonist stretches out its quiv&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>ering wings, and
                expires. A bee <pb n="18"/>
                <fw type="pagenumber" rend="align(centre)">16</fw> cannot be killed so suddenly,
                    ex&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>cept by crushing, as by the sting<lb/>of another
                bee. Sometimes the<lb/>stronger insect produces the death<lb/>of the vanquished by
                squeezing<lb/>its chest. After this feat has been<lb/>done, the victorious bee
                    constant&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>ly remains, says Reaumur, near<lb/>his victim,
                standing on his four<lb/>front legs, and rubbing the two<lb/>posterior ones
                together. Some&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>times the enemy is killed in the<lb/>hive;
                then the victor always car&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>ries the corpse out of the city
                and<lb/>leaves it. These combats are<lb/>strictly duels, not more than two<lb/>being
                concerned in them; and this<lb/>is even the case when armies of<lb/>bees meet in
                combat. <hi rend="italic">Murray's<lb/>Family Library.</hi></p>
