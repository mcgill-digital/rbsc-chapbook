                errand in the yard. A<lb/>wood&ndash;sawyer was at work there, and a<lb/>pile of
                wood was thrown up directly before<lb/>the door. Little Delia climbed

                safely in the door&ndash;way, smiling<lb/>as he did so, and saying to her in a

                fall.&rdquo;</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(3) align(justify)">Delia thanked him very pleasantly, and<lb/>went up
                stairs to tell her mother. &ldquo; Now,<lb/>mother, I like the woodman very
                much,<lb/>for he was so good to me,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo; He<lb/>lifted me kindly
                over the wood, so that I<lb/>shouldn&rsquo;t get hurt ; I thanked him plea&ndash;<lb

                gave me this morning ?<lb/>Wouldn&rsquo;t that be nice ?&rdquo; said Delia.</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(3) align(justify)">&ldquo; Yes, that would do very well,&rdquo;
                her<lb/>mother answered.</p>
            <p>Delia ran down and gave the apple,<lb/>quite delighted.</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(3) align(justify)">&ldquo; Thank you ; you&rsquo;re a good

                clothes took fire, and he<lb/>was sadly burned indeed. But he&rsquo;s a<lb/>good

            <p rend="first-indent(3) align(justify)">&ldquo; Yes, indeed,&rdquo; said Delia ; and
                she<lb/>ran quickly back into the house, and with<lb/>her mother&rsquo;s permission,
                brought out a<lb/>brown wooden horse. &ldquo; There, give that<lb/>to Johnny,
                too,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo; for I&rsquo;m sorry<lb/>that he&rsquo;s so
                burnt.&rdquo;</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(3) align(justify)">When the wood&ndash;sawyer returned home<lb/>at
                night, little Johnny sat watching for<lb/>him at the window ; and when he
                gave<lb/>him the horse and apple, Johnny thought<lb/>he had never seen so fine a
                plaything as<lb/>the horse, nor so large and red an apple<lb/>before, He kissed his
                father, and thanked<lb/>him heartily ; and then he kissed the<lb/>horse, and the
                apple too.</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(3) align(justify)">&ldquo; What are you going to do with

                asked<lb/>the father ; why, you don&rsquo;t like him so<lb/>much, do you
                ?&rdquo;</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(3) align(justify)">&ldquo; Not so much ; but I want him to<lb/>like me.
                I want to show him that I<lb/>don&rsquo;t hate him because he tries to make<lb/>fun
                of what I can&rsquo;t help, and what I am<lb/>sometimes so sorry for, though I know
                I<lb/>ought not to be, for God did it. I&rsquo;m<lb/>going to give Jim this
                beautiful apple, to<lb/>show him that it&rsquo;s only my face and
                leg<lb/>that&rsquo;s burnt.&rdquo;</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(3) align(justify)">The next day little Johnny watched at<lb/>the window,
                and when he saw the bad<lb/>boy, he beckoned to him. Jim did not<lb/>know what to
                make of it, and thought<lb/>Johnny meant to play him a trick in<lb/>return for all
                his unkindness ; so he did<lb/>not seem to notice Johnny&rsquo;s gesture.
                But<lb/>Johnny raised up the tempting apple, and<lb/>again beckoned to him to come
                to his<lb/>window.</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(3) align(justify)">&ldquo; Here, Jim,&rdquo; said Johnny, &ldquo;
                here&rsquo;s a<lb/>nice apple. I don&rsquo;t hate you. Won&rsquo;t you<lb/>love me
                now, Jim ?&rdquo;</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(3) align(justify)">The bad boy reddened with shame and<lb/>guilt. He
                could not take the apple.</p>

            <p rend="first-indent(3) align(justify)">The apple was tempting, and Jim took<lb/>it ; but as
                he went away looking at it, he<lb/>could not help feeling ashamed of him&ndash;<lb
                    type="inWord"/>self.</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(3) align(justify)">&ldquo; What a good boy that Johnny is,<lb/>when
                I&rsquo;ve acted so to him,&rdquo; he thought,<lb/>&ldquo; I&rsquo;m sorry I took
                his apple, for I don't<lb/>suppose he gets half as many as I do. &rdquo;</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(3) align(justify)">He could not eat the apple, so he took<lb/>it home
                and divided it among his brothers<lb/>and sisters. This was a new thing for<lb/>him,
                for instead of giving to them, he had<lb/>always tried to get from them.</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(3) align(justify)">Jim could not forget the apple.
                Johnny&rsquo;s<lb/>goodness was such a strange thing to him,<lb/>that he could not
                keep it out of his mind,<lb/>and the more he thought of it, the more<lb/>it seemed
                to soften him. He made no<lb/>more bad faces at Johnny, and soon began<lb/>to smile
                as he passed his window ; and<lb/>Johnny was very glad to see the change<lb/>in him,
                and always smiled pleasantly in<lb/>return.</p>

                give<lb/>to him, rather than he to me.&rdquo; Then he<lb/>thought, &ldquo; I have
                sometimes earned a few<lb/>pence by selling shavings ; why can't I<lb/>earn some
                money for Johnny ?&rdquo; He set<lb/>about it, and sold two baskets of
                shavings.<lb/>With the pence so gained, he bought some<lb/>sugar plums. He gave them
                to Johnny,<lb/>and was never so happy in his life before.<lb/>He was now, by
                degrees, growing generous<lb/>and kind to everybody, but particularly to<lb/>Johnny,
                for he felt something like gratitude<lb/>towards him, and he was learning to
                pity<lb/>him and love him, He took up a root of<lb/>pretty sweet&ndash;briar and
                planted it in a little<lb/>pot and set it in Johnny&rsquo;s window ; and<lb/>though
                it does not bloom very often, it is<lb/>always fresh and sweet.</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(3) align(justify)">Have you not noticed, little reader, how,<lb/>in this
                story, one little good act brought<lb/>on another and another, till there
                was<lb/>quite a chain of kind deeds ? There are<lb/>little good acts for you to do
                all the time.<lb/>Be sure you do them ; and who knows<lb/>what may come of it. A
