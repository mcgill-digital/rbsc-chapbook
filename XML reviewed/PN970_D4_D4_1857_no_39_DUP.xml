                Did<lb/>he ? for boys as well as men make capital<lb/>plans, which they da not

            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">No sooner said than Tom took his<lb/>writing
                materials, and sat down to write.<lb/>There was a great hurrah in the

                learn how<lb/>a word was spelled. &ldquo; Do you care<lb/>when you are only writing

                of<lb/>an hour, and he was ready to be off. And<lb/>so the afternoon was filled out
                as promptly<lb/>as that letter was filled up. That is a<lb/>specimen of Tom.</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">&ldquo; Uncle,&rdquo; said Tom, one day,

            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">Tom's uncle gave him a home for two<lb/>years,
                to attend to school and prepare for<lb/>college, and that gave him time to try
                the<lb/>bushes. In the autumn he dug around<lb/>their roots, pulled up the grass,
                separated<lb/>the large old bushes, and put out new<lb/>ones. It took time, but he
                worked<lb/>hard at it. In the spring he loosened<lb/>the soil, laid on some ashes,
                watched<lb/>the young shoots, kept some, and cut<lb/>down others. His uncle did not
                believe<lb/>much would come of it; but he had<lb/>reason to change his mind. Much
                    <hi rend="italic">did</hi><lb/>come of it. All at once, it seemed to
                him,<lb/>for time goes fast to an old man, his<lb/>bushes were loaded with fruit,

                knew<lb/>their value. His deceased father, a poor<lb/>minister, had taught him that
                every speck<lb/>and particle of time was worth its weight<lb/>of gold ; and his son
                took care of them as<lb/>if they were. He never spent them<lb/>foolishly, but only
                in good bargains; &ldquo; for<lb/>value received &rdquo; was stamped on all
