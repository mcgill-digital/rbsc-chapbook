                <p rend="align(justify)">I HAVE a simple story to tell you, dear young<lb/>readers,
                    which I think will please you. But I<lb/>wish it to do more than this: I hope it
                    will<lb/>make you feel thankful for the blessings you<lb/>enjoy,&mdash;those
                    blessings that are too often little<lb/>thought of by those who possess them,
                    but<lb/>which are sadly missed when sometimes they<lb/>are lost. I mean the
                    blessings of comfortable<lb/>homes, kind parents and friends, plain
                        whole&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>some food and enough of it, and good

                <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">It may be that you have heard of the city
                    of<lb/>Westminster, and know that it is close to<lb/>London; and that in this
                    city are the Queen's<lb/>palace, the houses of parliament, and many<lb/>great
                    and noble buildings besides. You may<lb/>have been told, too, that there are
                    many fine<lb/>streets and squares in Westminster. And so <pb n="5"/>

                    you know of that<lb/>city, you have yet much to learn; for in no<lb/>place in
                    England can greater poverty, wretch&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>edness, and vice be
                    found. Behind the fine<lb/>streets, and around the beautiful buildings,
                    are<lb/>lanes and courts, where dwell hundreds of<lb/>miserable creatures,
                    crowded together in old<lb/>filthy houses, which look ready to tumble
                    down;<lb/>&mdash;and they live there in fearful ignorance, and<lb/>in the
                    practice of almost every kind of sin,<lb/>without hope and without shame.</p>

                    those filthy courts of Westminster,<lb/>and in one of the dirtiest old houses in
                    that<lb/>court, was a strange and motley assemblage to<lb/>be seen. From the
                    cellar up to the third<lb/>storey of the house, every room was crowded<lb/>with
                    living creatures. To begin at the cellar,<lb/>which opened into the court by a
                    sort of trap&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>door and a flight of broken
                    steps,&mdash;to begin<lb/>there, I say, might be seen a group of two
                    or<lb/>three families of gipsies, with their poor ill&ndash;<lb type="inWord"

                    baskets and luggage all<lb/>scattered about in confusion on the
                    floor.<lb/>Children were crying, women were scolding,<lb/>and the men, seated
                    lazily on their dirty bun&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>dles, were smoking their
                    short black pipes, and<lb/>occasionally, commanding silence by angry
                    and<lb/>fierce threatenings, mixed with awful oaths.<lb/>These gipsies had
                    probably just returned from<lb/>some country excursion, and were making
                    up,<lb/>in idleness, for the fatigues of the journey,<lb/>while they were

                    beer,<lb/>which were being passed quickly round from<lb/>men to women, and from
                    women to children,<lb/>amidst all the crying, scolding, and profanity<lb/>of the

                    />erty might have been witnessed. Here was a<lb/>room in which, stretched on
                    some dirty straw,<lb/>and covered only with a ragged quilt, lay a<lb/>woman in
                    great pain and sickness, apparently<lb/>near dying, with no one to attend to her
                    wants,<lb/>but surrounded by a group of noisy, dirty<lb/>children, who disturbed
                    the poor suffering<lb/>mother with their uproar. In another apart&ndash;<lb
                        type="inWord"/>ment, were half&ndash;a&ndash;dozen men, drinking,
                        smok&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>ing, and playing at cards, which game
                    presently<lb/>led to wrangling, till they all rushed from the<lb/>house to fight
                    out their quarrel in the court<lb/>below. Another room, nearly at the top of
                    the<lb/>house, was closely shut, and barred withinside;<lb/>and there, if any
                    one could have obtained a<lb/>peep, might probably have been seen a gang
                    of<lb/>thieves, dividing the fruits of their wickedness,<lb/>or a gang of
                    coiners, melting base metal, and<lb/>casting it into moulds, that it might be
                    passed<lb/>for real silver money.</p>
                <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">Above all this din, and confusion, and
                    crime,<lb/>there was a miserable loft which had only one<lb/>occupant on the day
                    of which I am writing.<lb/>The only way to get into this loft was by a <pb n="7"/>
                    <fw type="header" rend="align(centre)">AND HIS FRIEND THE COBBLER.</fw>
                    <fw type="pagenumber" rend="align(right)">7</fw> broken step&ndash;ladder, which
                    led to a low door,<lb/>just beneath the roof of the house; but though<lb/>there
                    is some danger in climbing a broken lad&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>der in the
                    dark&mdash;for dark it was&mdash;we must<lb/>venture&mdash;in fancy, that
                    is&mdash;to ascend it: for<lb/>the occupant of that comfortless abode is
                    the<lb/>hero of my history.</p>
                <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">Well, here we are, at the top of the
                    ladder,<lb/>and here is the door:&mdash;we can feel the latch:<lb/>but we lift
                    the latch in vain: the door will not<lb/>open. Ah, we have found out the
                    mystery<lb/>now: just above the latch is a strong nail<lb/>driven into the door,
                    and the fellow to it is<lb/>driven into the door&ndash;post, and a strong cord
                    is<lb/>tied tight from one nail to another. Ho, ho!<lb/>we have a prisoner,
                    then, in this sad hole of a<lb/>garret.</p>
                <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">Even so, young friend. Well, we will
                    not<lb/>disturb the cord that fastens the door; for our<lb/>thoughts and fancies
                    can enter where our<lb/>bodies cannot: and so here we are, on the<lb/>broken
                    floor of that dismal prison. There is<lb/>no window; but light enough passes
                    through<lb/>the broken tiling of the roof, to let us see all<lb/>that is to be
                    seen.</p>
                <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">And little enough that is. At one end
                    of<lb/>the place, just behind a stack of chimneys,<lb/>which goes through the
                    loft without affording<lb/>it a fire&ndash;place, is a scanty heap of
                    shavings,<lb/>which, no doubt, is intended for a bed. In<lb/>another place, is
                    an old tin kettle without han&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>dle or lid, and a broken
                    basket without a bot&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>tom, a bundle of rags, and a
                    thick, strong<lb/>walking&ndash;stick. This is all. You may look<lb/>around in
                    vain for any other furniture. There<lb/>is neither chair, table, nor
                    cupboard.</p>

                    at<lb/>the end where the chimney&ndash;stack is: every<lb/>other side of it is
                    formed of the thin, broken<lb/>roof; and the cold wind, and the drifting
                    rain<lb/>of the miserable March day on which I am<lb/>supposing our visit to be
                    made, enters so freely<lb/>through the hundreds of cracks and crevices<lb/>that
                    one had need to have on a thick great&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>coat, and to

                    would be puny for a child of seven or<lb/>eight. We shall be about right,
                    probably, if<lb/>we make a guess between the two accounts,<lb/>and set him down
                    at ten. Sad and sulky does<lb/>the boy look, as he sits bare&ndash;headed,
                        bare&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>footed, and half&ndash;naked besides, on the
                    damp,<lb/>rotten floor. His hair is matted to his head,<lb/>and grim and dirty

                    sunshine, though they<lb/>are far enough from smiles now. Ah, young<lb/>reader,
                    you little know how many bright<lb/>glances and sunny smiles are quenched by

                    when not at his work,<lb/>you would not guess at his trade, except
                    by<lb/>looking at his hands, which he could not quite<lb/>keep clear from the

                    say,&rsquo; returned<lb/>Joseph Brunton; and thus saying, he led the<lb/>boy
                    towards the shop.</p>
                <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">&lsquo;Now, sit thee down, my boy,&rsquo;
                    said the kind&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>hearted man, in a serious, but
                    encouraging<lb/>tone; &lsquo;sit thee down, I say; I must have a<lb/>little talk
                    with thee.&rsquo;</p>
                <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">The boy obeyed; but he looked at the
                        door&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>way as if projecting a speedy escape as soon
                    as<lb/>possible. Mr. Brunton observed this, and<lb/>calmly shut and fastened the
                    door. &lsquo;Thee must<lb/>sit still,&rsquo; he said.</p>
                <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">The boy looked at him
                    uneasily.&mdash;&lsquo;You are<lb/>going to beat me,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;but
                    you had<lb/>better not, I tell you.&rsquo;</p>
                <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">&lsquo;And why had I better not?&rsquo;
                    said Joseph<lb/>with a smile: &lsquo;or why should I beat thee, poor<lb/>boy?
                    What good would that do?&mdash;None to<lb/>me, I know; and none to thee, I
                    think. No,<lb/>no, I shall not beat thee.&rsquo;</p>
                <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">The boy brightened up, and there was
                    a<lb/>pleasant twinkle in his blue eye that caught<lb/>Joseph Brunton's
                    attention. He looked more<lb/>closely at the little prisoner, and, in spite
                    of<lb/>dirt and rags, and in spite too of matted hair,<lb/>and cheeks pinched
                    in, perhaps with hunger,<lb/>there were marks of openness and even beauty<lb/>in
                    the face of the little thief. &lsquo;Alas!&rsquo; muttered<lb/>Joseph to
                    himself; &lsquo;if this poor boy had had<lb/>good parents and good instruction
                    and a happy<lb/>home, how different would he seem. Many a <pb n="18"/>

                <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">&lsquo;You did not see me,&rsquo; said the

                    &lsquo;What<lb/>is thy name, boy?&rsquo; continued Mr. Brunton.</p>
                <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">&lsquo;It's no odds&rsquo; said the boy,
                    who had been<lb/>taught not to commit himself unnecessarily by<lb/>giving up his

                <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">&lsquo;Well, my child;&rsquo; said the

                <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">And have you parents?&rsquo;</p>
                <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">The boy shook his head.</p>
                <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">&lsquo;And dost thee not know it is very

                    as<lb/>Joseph Brunton could gather from him.</p>
                <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">As long ago as Timothy's memory
                    could<lb/>take him back on the stream of life, his resting<lb/>place at night
                    used to be under cover of an old<lb/>blanket tent, beneath the hedges of Kent
                    and<lb/>Sussex; and his home by day, a donkey cart,<lb/>which contained, besides
                    himself, all the<lb/>worldly goods of his &lsquo;granny and
                    mammy,&rsquo;<lb/>including a collection of rags, rabbit skins<lb/>and hare
                    skins, and old metal, which they tra&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>velled the country
                    to gather, either honestly<lb/>or dishonestly, and which, as often as
                    they<lb/>could, they disposed of in pedlary shops, in<lb/>exchange for money or
                    goods. This was the<lb/>pleasantest part of Timothy's life; for though<lb/>he
                    then suffered much neglect and some<lb/>cruelty, his &lsquo;granny&rsquo; was
                    generally kind to<lb/>him; and so was his &lsquo;mammy&rsquo; when in a
                    good<lb/>temper; but at other times she used to beat<lb/>him without mercy.</p>

                <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">He knew nothing about a
                    father:&mdash;perhaps<lb/>he had one, he did not know; and at that<lb/>time he
                    knew nothing about uncle Tom.</p>
                <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">His life continued with little change,
                    except<lb/>that of scene and seasons, until little Timothy<lb/>could run by the
                    side of the donkey, instead<lb/>of continually riding in the cart. Then
                    he<lb/>was taught to beg, to lie, and to steal, and was<lb/>often beaten for
                    want of success. At times he<lb/>used to accompany his granny and mammy
                    to<lb/>country fairs, where they made a stall with<lb/>their tent blanket and
                    donkey cart, and sold a<lb/>few toys, while he&mdash;poor little
                    wretch&mdash;was<lb/>sent into the crowd, in his rags and dirt, to<lb/>beg or to
                    pick up dishonestly anything that<lb/>came in his way. At one of these
                    places,<lb/>uncle Tom made his appearance, and Timothy<lb/>was told he was his
                    father's brother. This<lb/>was &lsquo;the summer before last,&rsquo; Tim said;
                    and<lb/>since then he had travelled the country with<lb/>them, or else lived in
                    a mud hut by the road&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>side, which they hired for a
                    single winter, be&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>cause &lsquo;granny was getting old
                    and lame&rsquo;; and<lb/>also because the poor donkey fell down one<lb/>day and
                    broke its leg, and was killed by uncle<lb/>Tom. In this miserable place they
                    lived a sad<lb/>life; for Uncle Tom used to beat his mammy<lb/>and his granny
                    every day, and himself too;<lb/>but they bore through all this bad usage,
                    and<lb/>the poor boy began to find that the more<lb/>cruelly uncle Tom used his
                    mammy, the more<lb/>cruelly he himself was treated by her. At<lb/>this time,
                    they all lived by begging and thiev&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>ing; and very sadly
                    the poor boy seemed to<lb/>have fared.</p>

                <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">&lsquo;Why, as to dress; he had not much
                    to<lb/>boast of, besides an old ragged coat that had<lb/>been a man's
                    once&mdash;&rsquo; I need not record any<lb/>more of this conversation.</p>
                <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">&lsquo;There, Joseph, did you hear?&rsquo;
                    said Mar&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>tha, when her customer was gone.
                    &lsquo;There's<lb/>an end of your fancy, I should think.&rsquo;</p>
                <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">&lsquo;Yes, Martha, I hear. Doubtless, it
                    is<lb/>little Timothy. I grieve for the poor boy,&rsquo;</p>
                <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">&lsquo;Well, it is a bad thing for him, to
                    be sure,&rsquo;<lb/>replied Martha, softening a little: &lsquo;but it is<lb/>no
                    use grieving, Joseph. You had better for&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>get the boy.
                    It is all done with now, at any<lb/>rate.&rsquo;</p>
                <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">But Joseph Brunton could not forget
                    the<lb/>boy so easily. Thump, thump, thump, went<lb/>his hammer on the bit of

                <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">And so he had; and day after day, for

                <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">And Martha knew well enough the

                    she<lb/>soon entered as warmly even as Joseph could<lb/>desire, into all his

                    if they were asked? or would they not<lb/>contrive, by Timothy's means, to rob
