                blind grandfather, knitting warm<lb/>woollen stockings for his use against
                the<lb/>ensuing winter; a book lay open before<lb/>her, from which she was
                endeavoring to<lb/>acquire the French language without the<lb/>assistance of a
                master.</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">Now, some of my readers may feel a<lb/>little
                incredulous respecting the possibili&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>ty of this double

                they possess any skill in that<lb/>useful art.</p>

                denied her<lb/>the advantages of a liberal education.<lb/>Thus, with an ardent
                desire to obtain in&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>formation, she was left entirely to
                her<lb/>own resources for its acquirement.</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">The recent death of her good and
                pious<lb/>grandmother had engaged Rachel, at the<lb/>early age of fifteen, in those
                active duties<lb/>which the mistress of a family is always<lb/>called upon to
                perform. The time she<lb/>had hitherto spent in endeavoring to ac&ndash;<lb
                    type="inWord"/>quire knowledge, was now devoted to the<lb/>comforts of her aged
                grandfather; for Ra&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>chel had been early taught to
                discriminate<lb/>between what was right, and what only<lb/>appeared to be so from
                the inclination she<lb/>felt to pursue it. She knew there was no<lb/>absolute
                necessity for her becoming an<lb/>accomplished woman, while an actual<lb/>reason
                existed for her becoming a useful<lb/>one.</p>

                share the<lb/>pure bracing air of a September afternoon<lb/>with some companions of
                her own age ?<lb/>No! for the same gay sunbeams glittered<lb/>upon the silver hair
                of her grandfather,<lb/>who was sleeping in his easy chair, and<lb/>whose afternoon
                slumbers she was accus&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>tomed to watch. His infirmities
                had<lb/>doubly endeared him to Rachel, and she<lb/>loved him too well ever to wish

                    ex&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>pressive countenance of the orphan? The<lb/>fact
                was, that she experienced some new<lb/>difficulty in learning the French
                    lan&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>guage, and she wanted some one to ex&ndash;<lb
                    type="inWord"/>plain the meaning of the words that puz&ndash;<lb type="inWord"
                />zled her.</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">At this moment she dropped her knit&ndash;<lb
                    type="inWord"/>ting, and leaning her aching head on her<lb/>hands, pushing the
                book from her, half<lb/>determined to give up the attempt alto&ndash;<lb
                    type="inWord"/>gether. This state of mind was followed<lb/>by discontent and
                repining, and she began<lb/>to contrast her situation and all its disad&ndash;<lb
                    type="inWord"/>vantages, with the opportunities for in&ndash;<lb type="inWord"
                />struction enjoyed by many others.</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">Rachel's conscience, however, soon re&ndash;<lb
                    type="inWord"/>proached her for her ingratitude to Him<lb/>who had provided her
                with food and rai&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>ment, and who had given her a book
                of<lb/>instruction, whose knowledge was able to<lb/>make her wise unto salvation ;
                and she<lb/>felt that the learning to be acquired there,<lb/>would endure

                things should be for&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>gotten. She wept, while she thought
                of<lb/>these unthanked&ndash;for mercies, and taking<lb/>down the bible, resolved to
                compose her<lb/>mind with reading a chapter, before she<lb/>continued her work.</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">It happened that she opened at these<lb/>words:
                &ldquo;The fear of the Lord is the<lb/>beginning of wisdom ; and the knowl&ndash;<lb
                    type="inWord"/>edge of the Holy One is understanding;&rdquo;<lb/>and this
                sentence seemed to reprove her<lb/>repinings, and to carry conviction
                and<lb/>consolation to her heart.</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">Rachel then resumed her employment,<lb/>and
                soon overcame the difficulty that per&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>plexed her so much ;
                indeed, the time we<lb/>often spend in vain lamentation, when any<lb/>little trouble
                befalls us, would generally<lb/>set every thing right again, if we applied<lb/>it
