            <p>IT was a sultry afternoon in the month of<lb/>August, that Peter Hampton, a poor
                but<lb/>worthy fisherman, and his little son, Davie,<lb/>a lad of some nine summers,
                wearily<lb/>plodded their way across a sandy waste.<lb/>Davie&rsquo;s cheeks were
                flushed with heat ; <pb n="3"/>
                <fw type="header" rend="align(centre)">THE FISHERMAN AND HIS SON.</fw><fw
                    type="pagenumber" rend="align(right)">3</fw> the big drops of perspiration stood
                upon<lb/>his brow ; and his soft flaxen curls were<lb/>much displaced. The tract of
                country<lb/>over which they passed was not entirely<lb/>barren ; here and there
                might be seen a<lb/>little herbage, or a few scraggy bushes ;<lb/>but even these
                were parched by the heat,<lb/>for it was long since these crisped leaves<lb/>and
                blades of grass had tasted a refreshing<lb/>shower.</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(3) align(justify)">Little Davie had accompanied his father<lb/>on a
                fishing excursion, having left their<lb/>humble cottage early on the morning
                of<lb/>the previous day, full of hope. But for<lb/>some reason or other, Peter,
                though a<lb/>fisherman by trade, was not sufficiently on<lb/>his guard in time for
                the tide, and so the<lb/>little boat was carried out upon the then<lb/>unfriendly
                waters. The great waves<lb/>dashed it about like a feather, and seemed<lb/>every
                moment ready to swallow it up.<lb/>But the poor man&rsquo;s prayer was heard
                ;<lb/>and &ldquo; He who holdeth the waters in the<lb/>hollow of His hand,&rdquo;
                and ruleth the fierce<lb/>winds, suffered them not to overwhelm<lb/>them. But after
                tossing to and fro, during <pb n="4"/>

                any<lb/>habitation, and their supply of provisions<lb/>was indeed discouragingly
                small. Such<lb/>questions as these were continually rising<lb/>in Davie&rsquo;s
                mind. To which the father<lb/>replied, &ldquo; My son, God, who rescued us<lb/>from
                a watery grave, will protect us still.&rdquo;</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(3) align(justify)">&ldquo; But come ! we must not waste our<lb/>time in

                sandy waste and rugged moun&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>tains, to their humble
                dwelling, as dear to<lb/>them as a palace, nothing daunted by<lb/>intervening
                distance. Little Davie, after<lb/>the terrors of the night at sea,
                greatly<lb/>rejoiced to set his feet on solid earth again,<lb/>and was very willing
                to set out homeward<lb/>on foot. For a time he ran along joyously,<lb/>and even
                endeavoured to urge his father to<lb/>a more rapid movement. But
                by&ndash;and&ndash;by<lb/>their course lay through a more desolate<lb/>region ; the
                sun rose higher, and the heat<lb/>waxed more and more intense, and scarce<lb/>a
                breeze disturbed the sultry air. No<lb/>water could be found to cool their
                parched<lb/>lips ; no inviting shade&ndash;trees greeted their<lb/>eyes, or extended
                their friendly arms to<lb/>shelter them from the oppressive heat.<lb/>On, on they
                must go. Little Davie&rsquo;s<lb/>energies were severely taxed. He grew<lb/>faint,
                and his courage beginning to fail,<lb/>and hope to die out, he exclaimed :</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(3) align(justify)">&ldquo; Pa, shall we <hi rend="italics">never</hi>

            <p rend="first-indent(3) align(justify)">&ldquo; That was a miracle, my son ;

            <p rend="first-indent(3) align(justify)">&ldquo; But, Pa, I feel so weak ; my head<lb/>aches

            <p rend="first-indent(3) align(justify)">&ldquo; We must not stop here,&rdquo; said
