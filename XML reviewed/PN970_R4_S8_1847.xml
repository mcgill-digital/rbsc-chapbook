            <p>SUSAN is a little girl, and is now<lb/>nearly ten years old. She was<lb/>always a
                kind and pleasant child,<lb/>except that she once had a very<lb/>sad fault. When she
                could have<lb/>her own way, her face looked <fw type="signature" rend="align(right)"

                <fw type="header" rend="align(centre)">SUSAN AND HER BIRTH&ndash;DAY.</fw><lb/>
                bright and happy; but when she<lb/>could not, she showed a sullen<lb/>and naughty
                temper.</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">It was Susan's ninth birth&ndash;day,<lb/>in
                the month of June. She had<lb/>looked forward with great delight<lb/>to this time
                for many weeks, for<lb/>her kind parents had promised<lb/>her that she should have
                some of<lb/>her young friends for company<lb/>on that day. As there is a
                    beauti&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>ful park about two miles from her<lb/>father's
                house, it was planned<lb/>that Susan and her visitors should<lb/>go about three
                o'clock, and take<lb/>with them the tea&ndash;things, and<lb/>have a very happy time
                of it<lb/>under the shade of the trees.<lb/>No wonder that she had set her<lb/>heart
                upon this treat. It was to<lb/>be <hi rend="italic">her</hi> party, and on <hi
                    rend="italic">her</hi> birth&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>day. The ride, and the
                feast, and <pb n="5"/>

                to<lb/>think of.</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">Susan thought the day was a<lb/>long time
                coming, but at last it did<lb/>come. But it came with a storm<lb/>of rain. It was
                cold and cloudy<lb/>the day before, and in the night<lb/>it began to rain. And when
                the<lb/>little girl arose on the morning<lb/>of her birth&ndash;day, the rain
                was<lb/>falling in a slow, steady way,<lb/>which promised to last all
                day<lb/>long.</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">Susan was angry at the rain.<lb/>She said it
                always rained when<lb/>she wanted to go anywhere.<lb/>Then she began to pout,
                and<lb/>grow sullen. She did not wish<lb/>anybody to speak to her, or to<lb/>speak
                to any one. She went up<lb/>stairs after breakfast, and sat<lb/>down on a chair by
                the window <pb n="6"/>
                <fw type="pagenumber" rend="align(left)">4</fw>
                <fw type="header" rend="align(centre)">SUSAN AND HER BIRTH&ndash;DAY.</fw><lb/> and
                looked out at the rain, with<lb/>swollen eyes, flushed cheeks, and<lb/>a stubborn
                heart. Her mother<lb/>went up to her, and tried to<lb/>comfort her by saying that
                it<lb/>might be pleasant on the morrow,<lb/>and she should then have her<lb/>party,
                and keep the birth&ndash;day;<lb/>but she was too sullen and re&ndash;<lb
                    type="inWord"/>pining to be satisfied with such a<lb/>way of getting over her
                trouble.</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">In the course of the morning<lb/>Susan's father
                asked for his<lb/>daughter. He had a pretty<lb/>birth&ndash;day gift in his pocket
                to<lb/>give to her. But when he was<lb/>told that she had shut herself in<lb/>her
                room in the sulks, he went<lb/>up stairs. He then sat down<lb/>and talked to her
                very calmly<lb/>and seriously. He showed how <pb n="7"/>
                <fw type="header" rend="align(centre)">SUSAN AND HER BIRTH&ndash;DAY.</fw>
                <fw type="pagenumber" rend="align(right)">5</fw><lb/> wicked it was to cherish
                angry<lb/>thoughts and sullen feelings, and<lb/>that they would make her
                    un&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>happy in herself, and unlovely in<lb/>the eyes of
                others. &ldquo; And now,<lb/>Susan,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo; I do not ask if<lb/>you
                are sorry, for I fear you are<lb/>not. You still murmur at the<lb/>providence of
                God, and are angry<lb/>because you cannot have your<lb/>own way. Your conduct is
                    sin&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>ful, and must be punished. And<lb/>you shall be
                punished by letting<lb/>you have your own way. You<lb/>have chosen to come up into
                your<lb/>own room, and have nothing to<lb/>do with the rest of the family,<lb/>who
                would be glad to enjoy the<lb/>day in&ndash;doors with you. We<lb/>would have tried
                to please you;<lb/>you might have been with us, and <pb n="8"/>
                <fw type="pagenumber" rend="align(left)">6</fw>
                <fw type="header" rend="align(centre)">SUSAN AND HER BIRTH&ndash;DAY.</fw><lb/> you
                could have had the party of<lb/>little friends some other day.<lb/>But as you have
                chosen to be ill&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>tempered and sullen, sit here
                by<lb/>yourself. Your dinner and tea<lb/>shall be sent up to you, and you<lb/>can go
                to bed in the evening;<lb/>but I hope not till you have<lb/>repented of your sins.
                If you<lb/>feel in a better temper to&ndash;morrow<lb/>morning you can come
                down<lb/>stairs: if you do not, stay here<lb/>till I send for you.&rdquo;
                Susan's<lb/>father then told her to kneel<lb/>down with him while he prayed<lb/>that
                God would give his Holy<lb/>Spirit to change the heart of his<lb/>stubborn child,
                that she might<lb/>be sorry for her sins, and look by<lb/>faith to Jesus Christ to
                take<lb/>away their guilt.</p>

            <lb/>
            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">Susan was struck with sur&ndash;<lb
                    type="inWord"/>prise. She supposed that she<lb/>had a right to <hi rend="italic"
                    >feel</hi> just as she<lb/>pleased; but now she was taught<lb/>that sinful
                feelings are offensive<lb/>to God, and that they showed<lb/>her heart was wrong.
                Instead of<lb/>being humoured and coaxed as<lb/>she expected, she was punished.</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">It was a long, sad birth&ndash;day
                for<lb/>Susan; but before night she<lb/>began to think of what her<lb/>father had
                said to her, and she<lb/>saw she had been very wicked in<lb/>sinning against God,
                who had<lb/>sent the rain. She then knelt<lb/>down by herself, and wept as
                she<lb/>asked God to forgive her for the<lb/>sake of Jesus Christ. After she<lb/>had
                prayed, instead of idly look&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>ing out of the window at
                the<lb/>rain, she got her sewing, and <pb n="10"/>

                <fw type="header" rend="align(centre)">SUSAN AND HER BIRTH&ndash;DAY.</fw><lb/> went
                to work. In the evening<lb/>also she read a little book, and<lb/>a chapter in the
                New Testament.</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">At breakfast next morning,<lb/>Susan went into
                the breakfast&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>parlour, in a very humble manner,<lb/>yet
                with a smiling face. She<lb/>kissed her parents and said, &ldquo;Do<lb/>please,
                forgive me, and I will not<lb/>be so naughty again.&rdquo;</p>
            <p rend="first-indent(2) align(justify)">In a few days after this, Susan<lb/>had a party
                of her young com&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>panions : it was a very fine day,<lb/>and
                they were all quite happy to&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>gether in the park. Since
                that<lb/>time, Susan has not forgotten to<lb/>pray to God for his grace to
                keep<lb/>her from a sullen and bad spirit.<lb/>We are pleased to add that
                all<lb/>Susan's friends say she is now<lb/>quite an altered girl.</p>
