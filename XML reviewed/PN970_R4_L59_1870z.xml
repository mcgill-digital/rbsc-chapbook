                Rachel. &ldquo;Why do you<lb/>cry, Rachel? you wished to go<lb/>to the
                Sunday&ndash;school, and you<lb/>may be quite sure that no one<lb/>will hurt
                you.&rdquo; But the child<lb/>when she entered the room was<lb/>full of fear at
                finding herself<lb/>among so many strangers; and<lb/>besides, she was the least of
                all<lb/>the little girls in the new school.<lb/>She said to herself, &ldquo;I wish
                I<lb/>were at home again, and not in<lb/>this strange place.&rdquo; And when<lb/>one

                the<lb/>simple child. &ldquo;Well, Rachel,&rdquo;<lb/>she said, &ldquo;you shall not
                at present<lb/>learn from that large book. You<lb/>are only a little child, and I
                have<lb/>a book for you with short lessons.&rdquo;<lb/>Little Rachel smiled through
                her<lb/>tears, and longed to see this new<lb/>lesson&ndash;book. When it was
                shown,<lb/>to her, she saw it had nice pic&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>tures, and

                she was not quick<lb/>in learning, she attended to what<lb/>was said to her, and was
                never<lb/>idle. This was as it should be<lb/>with every child. After some<lb/>time
