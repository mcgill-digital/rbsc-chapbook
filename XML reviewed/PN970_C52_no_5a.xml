            for&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>merly was a companion to him in iniquity,<lb/>Robert, after enquiring of his
            health, &slong;aid,<lb/>&ldquo; Where are you going?&rdquo; He replied,<lb/>&ldquo; To buy a cock, we

            the colliers. Robert &slong;aid,<lb/>&ldquo; This is a bad errand any day, but much<lb/>&ldquo;
            wor&slong;e on the &slong;abbath ; I wi&slong;h you would<lb/>&ldquo; go with me to church.&rdquo; But GOD,
            who<lb/>had a kindne&slong;s towards him, &slong;ecretly in&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>clined his heart to yield to the
            &slong;olicitations<lb/>of the good man who prevailed upon him<lb/>to accompany him. The
            clergyman's text<lb/>was from I&slong;aiah, &ldquo; In that day &slong;hall the<lb/>&ldquo; branch of
            the Lord be beautiful and<lb/>&ldquo; glorious, and the fruit of the earth &slong;hall<lb/>&ldquo;

            vile&slong;t &slong;inners in the<lb/>&ldquo; world.&rdquo; Robert &slong;aid, &ldquo; I generally<lb/>&ldquo; bring a
            bit of bread and chee&slong;e in<lb/>&ldquo; my pocket, and if you will &slong;tay, you<lb/>&ldquo;
            &slong;hall have half of it &slong;or your dinner ;&rdquo; to<lb/>which he did not want much pre&slong;&slong;ing.
            In<lb/>the afternoon the clergyman addre&slong;&slong;ed<lb/>him&slong;elf to the wor&slong;t of
            &slong;inners, encouraging<lb/>them <hi rend="italic">to repent, and believe in the Saviour<lb/>of the
            world</hi>, &amp;c. The poor man wept<lb/>bitterly, but &slong;aid, &ldquo; He had a little gleam<lb/>&ldquo;
            of hope, that perhaps GOD might have<lb/>&ldquo; mercy upon his &slong;oul.&rdquo; His friend,
            &slong;ee&ndash;<lb type="inWord"/>ing him &slong;o deeply impre&slong;&slong;ed, &slong;aid, &ldquo; If he<lb/>&ldquo; had a mind, he would go

            &slong;poken of as being a very fine<lb/>&ldquo; preacher ;&rdquo; accordingly they went.
            His<lb/>&slong;ubject was on the leper's being healed;<lb/>when he appeared &slong;till more

            my coming<lb/>in, he &slong;aid, &ldquo;You and the phy&slong;ician are<lb/>&ldquo; come too late; I have
            neither life nor<lb/>&ldquo; hope. You both aim at miracles ; you<lb/>&ldquo; would rai&slong;e
