## DATASET/COLLECTION DESCRIPTION

This data set is the result of a Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) project built around the [McGill Library’s Chapbook Digital Collection](http://digital.library.mcgill.ca/chapbooks/). Rare Books and Special Collections created a TEI XML file for most of the chapbooks on this site using TEI P5:Guidelines for Electronic Text Encoding and Interchange by the TEI Consortium. Level 4 coding from Best Practices for TEI in Libraries was used to guide the encoding.  Note that the woodcuts in each chapbook were assigned a classification code from the Iconclass thesaurus to describe the subject of the image.

The McGill Library's Chapbook Collection was created from chapbooks from three special collections in the Rare Books and Special Collections Library.  The majority of the imprints (955 titles) are from the 19th century, published in England and the Northeastern United States. There are 74 Scottish and 19 Irish chapbooks in the collection. Most of the collection's 18th century titles were published in London, England.

## DATA &amp; FILE OVERVIEW

1. **File List:** The files are in two subdirectories: the 332 ‘reviewed’ files have been text proofed and verified by the project manager; the 572 ‘to be reviewed’ files have been text proofed but not reviewed and may not validate. File review status is also in the headers, which are minimal and lack bibliographic information. 
2. **File naming conventions:** File names are based on the original chapbook call number. 

## METHODOLOGICAL INFORMATION

1. **Description of methods used for collection/generation of data:** TEI encoding was done using \<oXygen\/\> XML Editor 15.0. See also the TEI_Reference_Guide_for_the_Chapbook_Project_July_15-2013.pdf document in this repository for more details.  
2. **Describe any quality-assurance procedures performed on the data:** see File list for details
