# rbsc-chapbook
The McGill Library Chapbooks digital collection was also a text encoding project. A team in Rare Books and Special Collections created a TEI XML file for each of the chapbooks using TEI P5:Guidelines for Electronic Text Encoding and Interchange by the TEI Consortium. Level 4 coding from Best Practices for TEI in Libraries was used to guide the encoding. Headers are minimal and without bibliographic information. The woodcuts in each chapbook were assigned a classification code from the Iconclass thesaurus to describe the subject of the image.
