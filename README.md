#The McGill Library’s Chapbook Digital Collection was also a Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) project. 

Rare Books and Special Collections created a TEI XML file for most of the chapbooks on this site using TEI P5:Guidelines for Electronic Text Encoding and Interchange by the TEI Consortium. Level 4 coding from Best Practices for TEI in Libraries was used to guide the encoding. The files are in two subdirectories: ‘reviewed’ files have been text proofed and verified by the project manager; ‘to be reviewed’ have been text proofed but not reviewed and may not validate. File review status is also in the headers, which are minimal and lack bibliographic information. Note that the woodcuts in each chapbook were assigned a classification code from the Iconclass thesaurus to describe the subject of the image.
